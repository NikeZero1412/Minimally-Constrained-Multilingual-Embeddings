9	-1	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .	-1

15	1	no matter the format .	-1
16	-1	i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .	-1
17	-1	picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .	-1
18	-1	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .	-1
19	1	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .	-1
20	-1	a disipointed customer .	-1
21	-1	bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .	-1
22	-1	the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel	-1
23	1	i liked this one enough to buy another .	-1
24	-1	cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .	-1
25	-1	for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .	-1

28	-1	i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .	-1
29	-1	my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .	-1
30	-1	i bought this thing because it plays everything .	-1
31	-1	i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .	-1
32	-1	so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .	-1
33	1	it plays everything , even vcd 's .	-1
34	-1	have had problems since the first day	-1
35	1	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .	-1
36	1	of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .	-1
37	-1	it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .	1
38	-1	4 .	-1
39	-1	i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .	-1
40	-1	if this is your fist dvd player .	-1
41	1	well , it was nice while it lasted .	-1
42	-1	i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .	1
43	-1	"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . """	-1

45	-1	there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !	-1
46	1	the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .	-1
47	-1	prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !	-1
48	-1	so , without further adoo .	-1
49	-1	no way to contact their customer service .	-1
50	-1	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .	-1
51	1	ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all	-1
52	-1	3 .	-1
53	-1	forget about it .	-1
54	-1	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .	-1
55	-1	i am returning the broken one today .	-1
56	-1	"hi , many people are saying , "" you get what you pay for , i guess . """	-1
57	-1	and then you will start to belive them .	-1
58	-1	and have returned both .	-1
59	1	the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .	1
60	-1	the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .	-1
61	-1	the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .	-1
62	1	it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .	-1
63	-1	what a disappointment !	-1
64	-1	it 's money down the drain .	-1
65	-1	save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .	-1
66	1	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .	-1
67	-1	i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .	-1
68	-1	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .	-1
69	-1	having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .	-1
70	-1	take my words and give it a try .	-1
71	-1	comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .	-1
72	-1	the entire unit was poorly crafted .	-1
73	-1	very happy !	-1
74	-1	i wish i could give negative stars !	-1
75	-1	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !	-1
76	-1	the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .	-1
77	-1	i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .	-1
78	-1	the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .	-1
79	-1	called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .	-1
80	-1	by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .	-1
81	-1	that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .	-1
82	-1	one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .	-1
83	-1	let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .	-1
84	1	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .	-1
85	-1	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !	-1
86	1	i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .	-1
87	-1	i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !	-1
88	1	there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .	1
89	-1	i dare you to surf the net and find the code .	-1
90	-1	hopefully you wo n't regret .	-1
91	-1	it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .	-1
92	-1	( i guess only time will tell ? )	-1
93	-1	the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .	-1
94	-1	bad :	-1
95	-1	some dvd 's i rented would not play .	-1
96	-1	one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .	-1
97	-1	new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .	-1
98	1	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .	-1
99	-1	wo n't play a lot of discs .	-1
100	1	i find this to be a great feature .	-1
101	-1	i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .	-1
102	-1	compusa , memorex , fuji .	-1
103	1	received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .	1
104	-1	what a mistake !	-1
105	1	have used it frequently and have had no problems .	-1
106	-1	forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.	1
107	-1	it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .	-1
108	-1	there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .	-1
109	-1	purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .	-1
110	-1	3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .	-1
111	-1	the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .	-1
112	-1	i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .	-1
113	-1	fair warning - do not buy .	-1
114	-1	i 'd recommend against this unit .	-1
115	-1	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .	-1
116	1	i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !	-1
117	-1	i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .	-1
118	-1	small problem .	1
119	1	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .	-1
120	-1	we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well .	-1
121	1	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .	-1
122	-1	i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .	-1
123	1	apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .	1
124	1	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .	-1
125	-1	i will never buy another apex digital product !	-1
126	-1	one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .	-1
127	-1	if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !	-1
128	-1	i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .	-1
129	-1	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .	-1
130	-1	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !	-1
131	-1	it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	-1
132	-1	finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .	-1
133	-1	still no response .	-1
134	1	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .	-1
135	-1	though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .	-1
136	-1	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .	-1
137	-1	it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .	-1
138	-1	in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .	-1
139	-1	i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .	-1
140	-1	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .	-1
141	-1	my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .	-1
142	-1	it wo n't play all of my movies .	-1
143	-1	but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .	-1
144	-1	however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .	-1
145	-1	i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !	-1
146	-1	i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !	-1
147	1	simple to use and hook up .	-1
148	-1	the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .	-1
149	-1	i bought this as a gift for my sister .	-1
150	-1	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .	-1
151	-1	i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .	-1
152	1	basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .	1
153	-1	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .	-1
154	1	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !	1
155	-1	they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .	-1
156	1	the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .	1
157	-1	imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .	-1
158	-1	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .	-1
159	1	and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?	1
160	1	the dvd player is fine .	1
161	1	i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .	-1
162	-1	i have been trying for over a week to contact apex .	-1
163	-1	i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .	-1
164	-1	before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .	-1
165	-1	the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .	-1
166	-1	as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .	-1
167	-1	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .	-1
168	-1	this is extemely lame .	-1
169	-1	wow !	-1
170	-1	i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .	-1
171	-1	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .	-1
172	1	so much packed in a small case and very affordable !	1
173	-1	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .	-1
174	-1	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !	-1
175	-1	customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .	-1
176	-1	p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?	-1
177	-1	because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .	-1
178	-1	thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .	-1
179	-1	unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .	-1
180	-1	their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .	-1
181	-1	if i could give this a negative rating , i would .	-1
182	-1	the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .	-1
183	-1	if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .	-1
184	-1	that is where my satisfaction ends .	-1
185	-1	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .	-1
186	-1	this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .	-1
187	-1	goodluck !	-1
188	-1	you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .	-1
189	-1	we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .	-1
190	-1	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .	-1
191	1	for the price it is a well spent investment !	1
192	1	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .	-1
193	1	so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .	-1
194	-1	there should have been a recall on this product .	-1
195	-1	i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .	-1
196	-1	but heck it plays my alias dvds .	-1
197	-1	i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .	-1
198	1	for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .	1
199	-1	now i need to buy myself another one !	-1
200	1	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .	1
201	-1	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .	-1
202	-1	usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .	-1
203	-1	after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .	-1
204	1	good quality video .	-1
205	-1	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .	-1
206	1	without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .	-1
207	-1	i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .	-1
208	1	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )	-1
209	-1	the case had ad2600 .	-1
210	-1	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .	-1
211	-1	i guess you get what you pay for .	-1
212	-1	however , it has failed to deliver on quality .	-1
213	-1	"can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me ."	-1
214	-1	i have a dvd burner .	-1
215	-1	i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .	-1
216	-1	i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .	-1
217	-1	i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !	-1
218	-1	by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .	-1
219	-1	or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?	-1
220	-1	"after "" loading "" for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated "" no disk "" ."	-1
221	-1	we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .	-1
222	-1	even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .	-1
223	-1	there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .	-1
224	-1	cameras capture moments .	-1
225	-1	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .	-1
226	-1	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .	-1
227	-1	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .	-1
228	1	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .	-1
229	-1	flaws ?	-1
230	-1	ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .	-1
231	-1	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .	1
232	1	the service from the supplier was exceptional .	-1
233	-1	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .	-1
234	-1	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .	-1
235	-1	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .	-1
236	-1	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .	-1
237	-1	i cancelled the order .	-1
238	-1	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .	-1
239	-1	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .	-1
240	1	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .	-1
241	-1	canon 's g3 does it consistently .	-1
242	-1	but who cares ?	-1
243	-1	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )	-1
244	1	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .	1
245	-1	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .	-1
246	1	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .	-1
247	-1	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .	-1
248	-1	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .	-1
249	-1	photos had some artifacts and noise .	-1
250	-1	after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .	-1
251	-1	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .	-1
252	1	i am very pleased with it so far .	1
253	-1	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .	-1
254	1	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .	-1
255	1	with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .	-1
256	-1	"anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference ."	-1
257	-1	highly recommended .	-1
258	-1	this camera performs like i can not believe !	-1
259	-1	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .	-1
260	-1	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .	-1
261	-1	* main dial is not backlit .	-1
262	-1	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .	-1
263	-1	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .	-1
264	1	the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .	1
265	-1	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .	-1
266	-1	"though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself ."	-1
267	1	the camera was a marvel .	-1
268	-1	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .	-1
269	1	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .	1
270	1	i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .	-1
271	-1	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .	-1
272	-1	b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .	-1
273	-1	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .	-1
274	-1	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .	-1
275	1	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .	-1
276	-1	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .	-1
277	-1	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .	-1
278	-1	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .	-1
279	-1	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .	-1
280	1	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .	-1
281	-1	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .	-1
282	-1	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .	-1
283	-1	why ?	-1
284	-1	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !	-1
285	1	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .	-1
286	-1	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :	-1
287	-1	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .	-1
288	-1	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .	-1
289	-1	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .	-1
290	-1	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .	-1
291	-1	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .	-1
292	-1	it is not perfect though .	-1
293	-1	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .	1
294	1	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .	-1
295	1	3 ) 4x zoom is nice	1
296	-1	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .	-1
297	-1	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .	1
298	1	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .	1
299	-1	yep .	-1
300	-1	the nikon 's are great cameras .	1
301	1	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .	1
302	1	but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .	-1
303	1	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .	-1
304	1	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .	1
305	1	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .	-1
306	1	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .	-1
307	-1	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .	-1
308	1	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .	1
309	-1	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .	-1
310	-1	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .	-1
311	-1	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .	-1
312	-1	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .	-1
313	1	the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .	1
314	1	i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .	-1
315	1	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .	1
316	-1	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .	-1
317	-1	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .	-1
318	-1	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .	1
319	-1	this camera has a major design flaw .	-1
320	1	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :	-1
321	1	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .	-1
322	-1	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?	-1
323	-1	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !	1
324	-1	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .	-1
325	1	excellent range of metering options as well .	1
326	-1	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .	-1
327	-1	it focuses in a snap .	-1
328	-1	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )	-1
329	1	"also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage ."	-1
330	-1	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .	-1
331	1	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .	1
332	1	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .	-1
333	1	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .	1
334	-1	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .	-1
335	-1	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .	-1
336	-1	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .	-1
337	-1	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .	1
338	-1	"and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image ."	-1
339	-1	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .	-1
340	-1	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .	-1
341	-1	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .	-1
342	1	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .	1
343	-1	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .	-1
344	-1	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .	1
345	-1	i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .	-1
346	-1	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .	-1
347	-1	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !	-1
348	-1	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .	-1
349	-1	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .	1
350	1	overall it is the best camera on the market .	1
351	-1	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .	-1
352	1	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .	1
353	1	i love this camera .	1
354	-1	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .	-1
355	-1	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .	-1
356	1	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .	-1
357	-1	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .	-1
358	-1	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .	-1
359	-1	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .	-1
360	1	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .	-1
361	-1	like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .	-1
362	1	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .	1
363	-1	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .	-1
364	-1	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .	-1
365	1	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .	1
366	-1	buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .	-1
367	-1	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).	-1
368	-1	excellent idea !	1
369	1	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .	-1
370	-1	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .	-1
371	-1	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .	-1
372	-1	warning - i did read the manual !	-1
373	-1	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .	-1
374	1	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .	-1
375	-1	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .	-1
376	-1	so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .	-1
377	-1	the canon g3 .	-1
378	1	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .	-1
379	-1	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .	-1
380	-1	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .	-1
381	1	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .	-1
382	1	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .	1
383	1	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .	1
384	-1	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .	-1
385	1	but canon never fails to amaze .	-1
386	1	this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !	-1
387	-1	this is not a handbag camera .	-1
388	-1	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :	-1
389	1	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .	-1
390	1	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .	-1
391	-1	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .	-1
392	-1	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .	-1
393	-1	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .	-1
394	-1	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .	-1
395	-1	"one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" ."	-1
396	-1	very easy to use .	1
397	-1	you can always spend more money to get a better one .	-1
398	-1	i give it 10 stars !	-1
399	-1	so buy the g3 .	-1
400	-1	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .	-1
401	1	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .	-1
402	-1	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .	-1
403	1	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .	1
404	-1	"if it had the same number of "" ? "" s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of "" ? "" s. . ."	-1
405	1	- large easy readable screen	1
406	-1	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .	-1
407	1	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).	-1
408	-1	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .	-1
409	-1	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .	-1
410	-1	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .	-1
411	-1	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .	-1
412	-1	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .	-1
413	-1	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .	-1
414	-1	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .	-1
415	-1	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .	-1
416	-1	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .	-1
417	-1	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .	-1
418	1	the sound from the player is ok .	-1
419	-1	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .	-1
420	-1	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .	-1
421	-1	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .	-1
422	1	the menus are very easy to navigate .	1
423	-1	"is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?"	-1
424	-1	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .	-1
425	-1	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .	-1
426	1	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .	1
427	-1	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .	-1
428	1	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .	-1
429	-1	i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .	-1
430	-1	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .	-1
431	1	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .	-1
432	-1	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .	-1
433	1	2 ) storage capacity	-1
434	-1	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .	-1
435	1	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .	-1
436	-1	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .	-1
437	-1	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .	-1
438	1	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .	-1
439	1	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .	-1
440	1	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .	-1
441	-1	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;	-1
442	-1	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .	1
443	1	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .	-1
444	1	the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .	-1
445	-1	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .	-1
446	-1	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .	-1
447	1	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .	-1
448	1	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .	1
449	-1	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .	-1
450	-1	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .	-1
451	-1	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .	-1
452	-1	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .	-1
453	-1	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .	-1
454	1	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .	-1
455	-1	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .	-1
456	-1	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .	-1
457	-1	wow , dennis sure is great !	1
458	-1	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .	-1
459	1	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .	-1
460	-1	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .	-1
461	-1	there was very little light in there .	-1
462	-1	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .	-1
463	-1	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .	-1
464	1	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .	-1
465	-1	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).	-1
466	-1	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .	-1
467	-1	one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .	-1
468	-1	subsequent behavior even worse .	-1
469	-1	so .. .	-1
470	1	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
471	-1	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .	-1
472	-1	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .	-1
473	1	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .	1
474	-1	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .	-1
475	1	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !	-1
476	1	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .	1
477	-1	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .	-1
478	1	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .	-1
479	-1	do not buy this product --	-1
480	1	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .	-1
481	-1	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .	-1
482	1	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .	1
483	-1	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .	1
484	-1	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .	-1
485	-1	"2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . """	-1
486	1	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .	-1
487	-1	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .	-1
488	-1	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .	-1
489	1	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .	1
490	1	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .	1
491	-1	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .	-1
492	-1	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .	-1
493	1	on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !	-1
494	1	its really cool .	-1
495	1	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .	-1
496	-1	good thing i got a replacement plan .	-1
497	1	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .	-1
498	-1	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .	-1
499	1	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .	-1
500	-1	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .	-1
501	-1	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .	-1
502	-1	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.	-1
503	1	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .	-1
504	-1	that 's important because i have a lot of music .	-1
505	-1	2 .	-1
506	-1	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .	-1
507	-1	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .	-1
508	-1	one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .	-1
509	1	this thing seriously is a good player though .	1
510	1	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .	-1
511	-1	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .	-1
512	1	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .	-1
513	-1	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .	-1
514	1	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .	1
515	1	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).	-1
516	-1	its great .	1
517	-1	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .	-1
518	-1	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .	1
519	-1	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .	-1
520	-1	that 's all for now .	-1
521	-1	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .	-1
522	-1	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .	-1
523	-1	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .	-1
524	-1	con :	-1
525	-1	"difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate ."	-1
526	-1	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .	-1
527	-1	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .	-1
528	1	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .	-1
529	-1	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .	-1
530	-1	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .	-1
531	-1	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .	-1
532	-1	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .	-1
533	-1	this almost made it worth the price alone .	-1
534	-1	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).	-1
535	-1	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .	-1
536	-1	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .	-1
537	-1	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .	-1
538	-1	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .	-1
539	-1	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .	-1
540	-1	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .	-1
541	-1	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .	-1
542	-1	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .	-1
543	-1	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )	-1
544	-1	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .	-1
545	-1	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .	-1
546	-1	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .	-1
547	-1	also , the instruction manual is very bad .	-1
548	1	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .	-1
549	1	it was no problem for me to use their software .	-1
550	1	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .	-1
551	1	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .	1
552	-1	"so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error ."	-1
553	1	other than that this thing is great ...	-1
554	-1	third party software to the rescue	-1
555	-1	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .	-1
556	-1	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .	-1
557	-1	carry your entire collection !	-1
558	-1	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .	-1
559	-1	ipod clearly has the most buzz .	-1
560	-1	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .	-1
561	-1	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .	-1
562	-1	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .	-1
563	-1	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours	-1
564	1	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	-1
565	-1	pros :	-1
566	-1	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .	-1
567	-1	2 .	-1
568	1	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player	-1
569	-1	i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .	-1
570	-1	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .	1
571	1	overall , a good buy for the price .	1
572	-1	now getting back to this .	-1
573	1	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .	-1
574	-1	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .	-1
575	-1	this is a powerful piece of equipment .	-1
576	-1	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .	-1
577	1	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .	-1
578	-1	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .	-1
579	1	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .	1
580	-1	zens rule .	-1
581	-1	oh ... one more thing .	-1
582	-1	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .	-1
583	-1	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .	-1
584	1	this player is an ideal purchase .	-1
585	-1	basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .	-1
586	-1	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .	-1
587	-1	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .	-1
588	1	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .	-1
589	-1	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .	1
590	-1	just get some new headphones and your set .	-1
591	1	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .	1
592	-1	they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .	-1
593	-1	neutral :	-1
594	-1	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .	-1
595	-1	recommendations :	-1
596	1	it 's easy .	-1
597	-1	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .	-1
598	-1	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .	-1
599	1	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .	1
600	-1	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .	-1
601	-1	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .	-1
602	-1	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .	-1
603	-1	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .	-1
604	-1	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )	-1
605	-1	do n't buy this player .	-1
606	-1	this thing is trash .	-1
607	-1	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	-1
608	-1	30gb is more than enough for most people .	-1
609	-1	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .	-1
610	-1	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .	-1
611	1	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .	-1
612	1	honestly , i love this player .	1
613	-1	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .	1
614	1	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .	1
615	-1	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !	-1
616	-1	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )	-1
617	-1	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .	-1
618	-1	cons :	-1
619	1	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .	-1
620	-1	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .	-1
621	-1	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .	-1
622	-1	enjoy !	-1
623	1	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .	1
624	-1	after that it seems like you 're on your own .	-1
625	-1	"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . """	-1
626	-1	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .	-1
627	-1	creative software stinks .	-1
628	-1	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .	-1
629	-1	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .	-1
630	-1	the general button placement is not very user friendly .	-1
631	-1	well i decided to get this one .	-1
632	1	then sorting the files is easy as pie .	1
633	-1	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .	-1
634	-1	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .	1
635	-1	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .	-1
636	1	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .	-1
637	-1	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .	-1
638	1	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .	1
639	-1	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .	-1
640	-1	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .	-1
641	-1	otherwise feedback seems to be good .	-1
642	-1	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .	-1
643	1	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .	1
644	-1	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .	-1
645	-1	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .	-1
646	-1	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .	-1
647	-1	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !	-1
648	-1	of course you do !	-1
649	-1	with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .	-1
650	-1	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .	-1
651	1	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .	1
652	1	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .	-1
653	-1	i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .	1
654	-1	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .	-1
655	-1	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .	-1
656	-1	7 .	-1
657	-1	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .	-1
658	-1	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )	-1
659	1	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .	1
660	-1	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .	1
661	-1	this is possible ! !	-1
662	-1	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well	-1
663	-1	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .	-1
664	-1	was i just unlucky at that moment ?	-1
665	-1	it 's horrible .	-1
666	1	overall i like the unit .	1
667	-1	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .	-1
668	-1	it may have taken several years to fill this up .	-1
669	1	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .	-1
670	-1	there are not a lot of good options out there .	-1
671	-1	10 .	-1
672	-1	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .	-1
673	1	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .	-1
674	-1	gee ... thanks a lot creative .	-1
675	-1	"now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource ."	-1
676	1	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )	1
677	-1	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said	-1
678	-1	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .	-1
679	-1	i will never buy a creative product again .	-1
680	-1	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .	-1
681	1	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .	-1
682	-1	and then it breaks .	-1
683	-1	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .	-1
684	-1	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .	-1
685	1	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !	-1
686	-1	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .	-1
687	-1	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .	-1
688	-1	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .	-1
689	-1	it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .	-1
690	1	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .	-1
691	-1	- price : see above .	-1
692	-1	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .	1
693	-1	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .	-1
694	-1	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .	-1
695	-1	if it does , ill give up .	-1
696	-1	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .	-1
697	-1	like other reviewers , installation was hell .	-1
698	-1	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .	1
699	-1	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .	-1
700	-1	also the ipod has games on it .	-1
701	1	i love my new nomad , its great !	-1
702	-1	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .	-1
703	1	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .	1
704	-1	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .	1
705	1	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .	-1
706	-1	it also has unproven battery life .	-1
707	-1	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .	-1
708	-1	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .	-1
709	-1	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .	-1
710	-1	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .	-1
711	-1	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .	-1
712	-1	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	-1
713	-1	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .	-1
714	-1	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )	-1
715	-1	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?	-1
716	-1	1 .	-1
717	-1	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .	-1
718	-1	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .	-1
719	-1	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .	-1
720	-1	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )	-1
721	-1	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .	-1
722	-1	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .	-1
723	-1	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .	-1
724	-1	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .	-1
725	-1	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .	-1
726	-1	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .	-1
727	-1	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...	-1
728	-1	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .	-1
729	-1	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .	-1
730	1	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .	1
731	-1	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .	1
732	-1	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .	-1
733	-1	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .	-1
734	-1	this would have been much easier .	-1
735	1	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .	1
736	-1	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !	-1
737	1	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .	1
738	-1	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .	-1
739	1	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .	1
740	-1	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .	-1
741	-1	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .	-1
742	1	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .	1
743	-1	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .	-1
744	1	"second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer ."	-1
745	-1	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .	-1
746	1	oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^	1
747	-1	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .	-1
748	-1	minor gripe .	-1
749	1	* price and capacity	-1
750	-1	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.	-1
751	1	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes	1
752	1	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .	-1
753	1	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .	-1
754	-1	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .	-1
755	-1	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .	-1
756	1	getting files onto it is quick and painless .	1
757	-1	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .	-1
758	-1	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .	-1
759	-1	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .	-1
760	-1	first let me give you the bad things :	-1
761	1	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .	1
762	-1	crappy headphones .	-1
763	-1	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !	-1
764	-1	i was a little disappointed in the low end .	-1
765	-1	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .	-1
766	1	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .	-1
767	-1	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .	-1
768	-1	"i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years ."	-1
769	-1	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .	-1
770	-1	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .	-1
771	-1	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .	-1
772	-1	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .	-1
773	-1	i do n't think so .	-1
774	-1	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .	-1
775	-1	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .	-1
776	1	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .	1
777	-1	software :	-1
778	-1	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .	-1
779	1	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .	-1
780	-1	4 .	-1
781	-1	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .	-1
782	1	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .	-1
783	-1	but the earbuds suck !	-1
784	-1	highly recommended !	-1
785	-1	if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .	-1
786	-1	the player itself has all sorts of problems .	-1
787	1	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .	1
788	-1	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .	-1
789	-1	details :	-1
790	-1	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .	-1
791	1	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .	1
792	-1	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .	-1
793	-1	do n't drop this unit :	-1
794	-1	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .	-1
795	-1	no issues as of yet	-1
796	-1	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .	-1
797	-1	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .	-1
798	-1	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .	-1
799	-1	anyway , on with the review .	-1
800	-1	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .	-1
801	1	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .	1
802	-1	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .	1
803	-1	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .	-1
804	1	and also , it 's priced very affordably .	1
805	-1	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .	-1
806	-1	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .	-1
807	1	it 's a very intuitive program .	-1
808	-1	3 .	-1
809	-1	i was prepared to love it .	-1
810	-1	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .	-1
811	1	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .	-1
812	-1	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .	-1
813	-1	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?	-1
814	1	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .	1
815	-1	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .	-1
816	-1	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .	-1
817	-1	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .	-1
818	-1	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .	-1
819	-1	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .	-1
820	1	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .	1
821	-1	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .	-1
822	1	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .	-1
823	1	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .	1
824	-1	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .	-1
825	-1	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .	-1
826	-1	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .	-1
827	1	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .	1
828	-1	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .	-1
829	-1	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .	-1
830	-1	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .	-1
831	-1	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .	-1
832	-1	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .	-1
833	1	"working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !"	-1
834	1	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .	1
835	1	it is an extremely cool gizmo .	-1
836	-1	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .	-1
837	-1	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .	-1
838	-1	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .	-1
839	-1	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !	-1
840	-1	i bought this only to have it break within a month .	-1
841	-1	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical	-1
842	1	overall i like it .	1
843	-1	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .	1
844	-1	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .	-1
845	-1	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .	-1
846	1	i 'm really happy with this purchase .	-1
847	-1	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .	-1
848	-1	bummer as it has great sound quality .	1
849	-1	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .	-1
850	-1	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .	-1
851	-1	is eax faulty ?	-1
852	-1	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .	1
853	-1	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .	-1
854	-1	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .	-1
855	-1	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .	-1
856	-1	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .	-1
857	1	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .	-1
858	-1	now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .	-1
859	-1	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .	-1
860	-1	player controls :	-1
861	-1	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .	-1
862	-1	get better headphones .	-1
863	1	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .	1
864	-1	look / design :	-1
865	-1	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .	-1
866	-1	1 .	-1
867	1	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .	1
868	-1	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.	-1
869	-1	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )	-1
870	1	- best in class sound	-1
871	-1	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .	-1
872	-1	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .	-1
873	-1	fm receiver - it has none .	-1
874	-1	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .	-1
875	-1	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .	-1
876	-1	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	-1
877	-1	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .	-1
878	-1	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .	-1
879	-1	almost half what an ipod would cost you !	-1
880	-1	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .	-1
881	-1	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .	-1
882	-1	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .	-1
883	-1	"the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best ."	-1
884	-1	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .	1
885	1	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .	1
886	1	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .	-1
887	-1	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !	-1
888	1	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .	-1
889	-1	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .	-1
890	-1	it did lock up on me a couple of times .	-1
891	-1	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .	-1
892	1	extremely convenient .	-1
893	-1	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .	-1
894	-1	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .	-1
895	-1	"point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest ."	-1
896	1	"1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers ."	1
897	-1	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .	-1
898	-1	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .	1
899	-1	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )	1
900	-1	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?	-1
901	1	+ screen was good , easy to read	1
902	-1	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .	-1
903	1	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .	1
904	-1	software - the software is crap .	-1
905	-1	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .	-1
906	-1	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist	-1
907	-1	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .	-1
908	-1	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :	-1
909	-1	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .	-1
910	-1	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .	-1
911	1	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .	1
912	-1	this thing does its job .	-1
913	-1	cons :	-1
914	-1	none of these are perfect .	-1
915	-1	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .	-1
916	-1	solution ?	-1
917	-1	my opinions :	-1
918	-1	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .	-1
919	1	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .	1
920	1	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .	-1
921	1	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !	-1
922	-1	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .	-1
923	1	they take excellent macro shots as well .	1
924	1	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .	-1
925	1	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .	1
926	-1	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .	-1
927	-1	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .	-1
928	1	"even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" ."	-1
929	1	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .	1
930	-1	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .	-1
931	1	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .	-1
932	-1	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .	1
933	1	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .	1
934	-1	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .	-1
935	-1	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .	1
936	1	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .	-1
937	-1	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .	-1
938	-1	4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .	-1
939	-1	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .	-1
940	-1	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .	-1
941	-1	a card with more memory is a must .	-1
942	-1	do n't let my five star rating fool you .	-1
943	1	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !	1
944	-1	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .	-1
945	-1	"in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features ."	-1
946	-1	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .	-1
947	-1	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .	-1
948	1	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .	1
949	-1	anybody can explain that ?	-1
950	-1	. lens cap is a really annoying	-1
951	-1	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .	-1
952	-1	go get it .	-1
953	-1	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .	1
954	-1	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .	-1
955	1	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .	1
956	-1	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .	-1
957	-1	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .	1
958	-1	"a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution ."	1
959	1	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .	-1
960	1	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.	1
961	1	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !	1
962	-1	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .	-1
963	1	great camera .	1
964	-1	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .	-1
965	-1	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .	-1
966	1	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .	-1
967	-1	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit	-1
968	1	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .	-1
969	-1	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .	-1
970	1	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !	1
971	-1	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .	-1
972	1	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .	-1
973	-1	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .	-1
974	-1	"1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while ."	-1
975	1	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .	1
976	1	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .	1
977	-1	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .	-1
978	1	the quality is superb .	1
979	-1	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .	-1
980	-1	now where did i put that manual ?	-1
981	1	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .	1
982	-1	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !	-1
983	-1	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .	-1
984	-1	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .	-1
985	-1	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .	-1
986	1	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .	1
987	-1	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .	-1
988	1	battery life is ok .	-1
989	1	the software you get with this camera is perfect .	1
990	1	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .	1
991	-1	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .	-1
992	1	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .	1
993	-1	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .	-1
994	-1	reason for two ?	-1
995	-1	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .	-1
996	1	seriously ! i love it !	1
997	-1	the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .	1
998	-1	with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .	-1
999	-1	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .	-1
1000	1	the picturers are amazing .	-1
1001	1	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .	1
1002	-1	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .	-1
1003	1	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .	-1
1004	-1	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .	-1
1005	1	really happy with this little camera .	1
1006	1	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .	-1
1007	1	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .	-1
1008	1	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .	-1
1009	1	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .	1
1010	-1	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .	-1
1011	1	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .	-1
1012	1	it takes great pictures .	1
1013	1	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .	1
1014	1	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .	1
1015	1	nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	1
1016	-1	2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .	-1
1017	-1	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !	-1
1018	-1	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .	-1
1019	-1	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .	-1
1020	-1	"5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome ."	-1
1021	-1	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .	-1
1022	-1	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .	-1
1023	-1	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .	-1
1024	-1	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .	1
1025	-1	the most important thing for me is sound quality .	1
1026	1	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .	-1
1027	1	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .	1
1028	-1	"i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" ."	-1
1029	-1	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .	-1
1030	-1	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .	-1
1031	-1	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .	1
1032	-1	i am bored with the silver look .	-1
1033	1	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .	1
1034	-1	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .	-1
1035	-1	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .	-1
1036	-1	that was annoying .	-1
1037	-1	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .	-1
1038	-1	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .	1
1039	-1	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .	-1
1040	-1	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .	-1
1041	-1	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .	-1
1042	-1	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .	-1
1043	-1	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .	-1
1044	1	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .	-1
1045	-1	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !	-1
1046	-1	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .	-1
1047	-1	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .	1
1048	1	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .	1
1049	-1	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .	-1
1050	-1	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .	-1
1051	-1	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .	-1
1052	-1	poor visibility on the keys .	-1
1053	-1	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .	-1
1054	-1	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .	-1
1055	1	yes , the features are numerous .	-1
1056	-1	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .	-1
1057	-1	it defaulted to unchangeable email .	-1
1058	-1	most of our emplyees use this model phone .	-1
1059	-1	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..	-1
1060	-1	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .	-1
1061	-1	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .	-1
1062	-1	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .	-1
1063	-1	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !	-1
1064	1	nokia does not disappoint in this model .	-1
1065	1	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .	1
1066	-1	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .	-1
1067	-1	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :	1
1068	1	great screen and great sound .	1
1069	-1	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .	-1
1070	-1	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .	-1
1071	-1	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?	-1
1072	1	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .	1
1073	-1	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .	-1
1074	-1	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .	-1
1075	-1	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .	-1
1076	-1	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .	-1
1077	-1	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .	-1
1078	1	but , i would definately recommend this phone .	-1
1079	-1	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .	-1
1080	-1	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .	1
1081	1	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .	-1
1082	-1	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .	-1
1083	1	the radio feature has superb sound quality .	1
1084	1	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .	1
1085	1	overall an excellent phone .	1
1086	-1	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .	-1
1087	-1	the vibration is not top .	-1
1088	-1	in all a winning combination .	-1
1089	1	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .	1
1090	-1	reason ?	-1
1091	-1	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .	-1
1092	-1	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !	-1
1093	1	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	-1
1094	1	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .	-1
1095	-1	battery :	-1
1096	-1	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .	-1
1097	1	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .	1
1098	1	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !	1
1099	-1	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .	-1
1100	-1	and no t-zones .	-1
1101	-1	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !	-1
1102	-1	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .	-1
1103	1	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .	1
1104	-1	- some features in the user interface	-1
1105	1	t-mobile was a pretty good server .	-1
1106	-1	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .	-1
1107	-1	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .	-1
1108	-1	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :	1
1109	-1	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .	-1
1110	-1	word ... peace in the east bruvah .	-1
1111	-1	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !	-1
1112	-1	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .	-1
1113	1	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .	-1
1114	1	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	-1
1115	-1	the speakerphone :	-1
1116	-1	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .	-1
1117	-1	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .	-1
1118	1	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .	1
1119	-1	only con i can think of is no camera ... .	-1
1120	-1	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .	1
1121	-1	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .	-1
1122	1	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )	-1
1123	-1	"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" ."	-1
1124	-1	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .	-1
1125	-1	great features . .	1
1126	-1	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .	-1
1127	-1	you do take your chances with this phone .	-1
1128	-1	"also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out ."	-1
1129	-1	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .	-1
1130	-1	cons :	-1
1131	-1	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .	-1
1132	-1	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .	-1
1133	-1	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !	1
1134	-1	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .	-1
1135	-1	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .	-1
1136	1	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .	1
1137	-1	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :	-1
1138	-1	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .	-1
1139	-1	overall design :	1
1140	-1	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .	-1
1141	1	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .	1
1142	1	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .	1
1143	1	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .	-1
1144	-1	cons :	-1
1145	1	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .	1
1146	1	this is the best phone i have seen .	1
1147	1	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !	1
1148	-1	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .	-1
1149	1	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	-1
1150	-1	features :	-1
1151	-1	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .	-1
1152	-1	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .	-1
1153	-1	go for it !	-1
1154	1	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .	1
1155	1	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .	1
1156	-1	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .	-1
1157	-1	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .	-1
1158	-1	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .	-1
1159	-1	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .	-1
1160	1	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .	1
1161	-1	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	-1
1162	1	great phone , i 'd buy another .	1
1163	-1	the vibrate setting is loud !	-1
1164	-1	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .	-1
1165	-1	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .	-1
1166	-1	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .	-1
1167	1	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .	-1
1168	-1	a great deal in general !	1
1169	-1	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .	-1
1170	-1	by what time standards -- martian ?	-1
1171	-1	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .	-1
1172	1	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .	1
1173	-1	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .	-1
1174	-1	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	-1
1175	1	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .	1
1176	-1	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...	-1
1177	1	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .	1
1178	-1	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .	-1
1179	1	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .	1
1180	-1	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .	1
1181	-1	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	-1
1182	-1	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .	-1
1183	-1	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .	-1
1184	-1	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .	1
1185	-1	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !	-1
1186	-1	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .	1
1187	-1	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .	1
1188	-1	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --	-1
1189	1	 I do n't want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible .	-1
1190	-1	 I do n't know why people buy expensive gadgets like ipad2 3G ... very satisfied and I think I made very good decision .	-1
1191	1	 it 's far from expensive for the specifications but there is a lot more than in there ... i like it so much ... its nicely designed for the portable user and I like the Ferrari design on it .	1
1192	-1	 If you spend a lot of money on a Mac Book Pro spend these extra few hundred too if you prefer a relaxed life .	-1
1193	-1	 There 's also no height adjustability , so it sits very low to the desk .	-1
1194	1	 Apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .	-1
1195	-1	 I 'm happy with my Dell .	-1
1196	1	 : P Fantastic little computer , does everything I had hoped for work\/study\/travel .	1
1197	-1	 Some specifics from my purchase experience were : 1 .	-1
1198	1	 I 'm not a person well read in technology but this is just an absolutely wonderful computer .	-1
1199	-1	 -LRB- I am running OS\/X Lion and I seem to have the current firmware in the display , and the latest drivers on OS\/X Lion -RRB- Compared to the old 15 '' display , it is like watching IMAX in comparison .	-1
1200	1	 its definately an outstanding laptop .	-1
1201	-1	 I also see a difference when surfing the web or using Microsoft Office applications .	-1
1202	-1	 I was dissapointed that Acer was n't more helpful .	-1
1203	1	 The colors are bright , beautiful and clear .	1
1204	-1	 Acer has been awful to deal with , they treat their customers like rubbish , and have a miserable repair facility to match their products .	-1
1205	1	 Not a bad monitor for $ 120 but it 's nothing special .	-1
1206	1	 Just an average user getting good value in this product .	-1
1207	-1	 A piece of advice : Get the new logitech optical USB mouse with the little app-switcher button on it , and assign that extra button to the Expose feature of OS X 10.3 .	-1
1208	-1	 I would not recommend this or any Acer product to anyone except perhaps my ex .	-1
1209	-1	 We use these monitors in the office .	-1
1210	-1	 Others may have better luck , but I have never seen a flat-panel with such horrible viewing angles .	-1
1211	-1	 Some of you may ask how did I gave 4\/5 while having the mentioned disadvantages .	-1
1212	1	 Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .	-1
1213	1	 Nice and compact .	1
1214	-1	 PotPlayer is the King of all PC media player .	-1
1215	1	 It worked great and we just pluged it in .	1
1216	-1	 I felt the system was slow so I purchased a 4gb ram from crucell and replaced the standard 2gb that came with the system .	-1
1217	-1	 Display glitches and flashes also occurred .	-1
1218	-1	 Even my SLI 570 's ca n't do that for Crysis , though .	-1
1219	-1	 At least from a work standpoint .	-1
1220	-1	 Of course , they do n't tell you they did nothing .	-1
1221	1	 The memory is not really hard to upgrade .	-1
1222	-1	 One of my monitors recently went south -LRB- quit working -RRB- , and I went looking for a replacement .	-1
1223	-1	 Update : I sent both machines back to Acer .	-1
1224	1	 This really is a laptop in a small form .	1
1225	-1	 To get the cables in , I had to nick bits of the plastic casing on the end of the cable -LRB- and these are the cables that ship in the box with the monitors ! -RRB-	-1
1226	1	 If you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs .	-1
1227	-1	 The package was unblemished and the code worked without any problems .	-1
1228	1	 This machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be .	-1
1229	-1	 I am an extremely experienced computer user .	-1
1230	-1	 I came close to ordering the 21 '' Samsung several times but really wanted a WS .	-1
1231	1	 I 've had this monitor for over a year and I absolutely LOVE IT !	1
1232	-1	 My only grips are the incompatibility with XP and the USB hub in the display .	-1
1233	-1	 Let me tell you that the monitor was in PERFECT cosmetic condition .	-1
1234	-1	 I was looking for an upgrade on a monitor .	-1
1235	1	 This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .	1
1236	1	 Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .	1
1237	-1	 Anyway , why is this a big deal , it 's just a beep ?	-1
1238	1	 Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .	-1
1239	-1	 Especially when you know you paid less than $ 100 for it !	-1
1240	-1	 The only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it .	-1
1241	-1	 I bought mine a few months ago and after just a week I noticed that my eyes felt better at night .	-1
1242	-1	 Very happy with purchase .	-1
1243	1	 I love that it is a tablet - it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop .	-1
1244	-1	 They guided me through some tests and from these concluded that I had a faulty iSight , but to my my enormous surprise said it was covered under my extended AppleCare warranty on my iMac -LRB- even after I told them it was a second hand purchase -RRB- , and promptly sent me a brand new replacement !	-1
1245	-1	 I use a netbook for all of my computing with the exception of tax programming and backup .	-1
1246	-1	 It does just what I need once fully configured : Add 4GB of ram , clean out pre-loaded junkware , and install CCleaner and MS Security Essentials .	-1
1247	1	 Image clarity is great -LRB- I do a lot of work in PhotoShop with 18MB RAW image files and noticed the difference immediately -RRB- .	1
1248	1	 However , you DO get what you pay for in reliable products .	-1
1249	-1	 Searches across the Net come up empty with these guys .	-1
1250	1	 I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .	1
1251	1	 This netbook is closer to the notebook powers but still very cheap .	1
1252	-1	 No problems whatsoever .	-1
1253	-1	 Everything is brighter and better defined on it .	-1
1254	1	 Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .	-1
1255	-1	 Very , very satisfied with it .	-1
1256	-1	 What a mistake .	-1
1257	-1	" Since I 've only had the computer for a few weeks I 'll report later on my further experience with the system <aï¿½href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB21KA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-0570718-7655811""> Crucial Technology CT51264BC1067 4 GB 204-pin SODIMM DDR3 PC3-8500 CL = 7 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR3-1066 1.5 V 512Meg x 64 Memory </a>"	-1
1258	-1	 I purchased this monitor because of budgetary concerns .	-1
1259	-1	 Would n't buy again because of the customer service .	-1
1260	-1	 The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .	-1
1261	1	 We like Acer products and this one does n't disappoint .	-1
1262	-1	 The image \* will \* go away if you either leave the monitor off for a while or leave a white area of a window under that part of the screen - but it takes time .	-1
1263	1	 Pros : Competitive Cost Win 7 Home premium HDMI port -LRB- I could watch the Amazon instant videos on my HDTV and its delivering great .	1
1264	-1	 I ca n't go back to using anything else at all .	-1
1265	-1	 I was waiting for lower pricess , faster respons time & wide screen monitor .	-1
1266	-1	 Two thumbs down .	-1
1267	1	 It 's very light-weight , which is why I use this more than my Alienware .	-1
1268	1	 Monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired NVIDIA glasses .	1
1269	-1	 I would imagine the cost will go upto 200 bucks one day and then it will be unbeatable deal .	-1
1270	1	 I think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses GPU hardware acceleration .	-1
1271	-1	 I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .	-1
1272	-1	 Did not have a ring around it like other reviews stated .	-1
1273	1	 I do n't think that really matters though - I mean hooked my Xbox 360 up to the standard VGA port a little while ago and the picture was awesome .	-1
1274	-1	 I managed to find their mysterious phone number from a google cache and called them .	-1
1275	-1	 You will not be disappointed .	-1
1276	-1	 There are numerous detailed installation guides and even a few videos online to get you through the ` cracking the case ' scenario and I definately suggest getting some putty knives over the other strange techniques online .	-1
1277	1	 the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person , it worked fine , fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it , in fact it works better than my own laptop so I will change to this one as soon as possible	1
1278	-1	 So , I could not wait anylonger & I got it .	-1
1279	-1	 I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .	-1
1280	-1	 etc. -RRB- you do n't notice it at all .	-1
1281	1	 This product is hard to beat at any price .	-1
1282	-1	 I 'm not a fan of tablet computers .	-1
1283	-1	 Well , other people do - I use a Dell 20 '' LCD .	-1
1284	-1	 Some people may not like this , but it is very simple .	-1
1285	-1	 Please ignore all the posts about turning off the sounds under sounds .	-1
1286	1	 It has good color and price was great .	1
1287	-1	 It is bigger than the dell and the hp mini .	-1
1288	1	 These monitors are great for the price .	1
1289	-1	 It received no signal despite the manufacturers web site indicating full services in my location .	-1
1290	-1	 never ever .	-1
1291	-1	 No surprises .	-1
1292	-1	 It certainly does .	-1
1293	-1	 3G Technologies ?	-1
1294	1	 Not that Apple computers break down often but this is cheap insurance for 3 years .	-1
1295	-1	 4 .	-1
1296	-1	 I got this product yesterday ... !!!	-1
1297	1	 The color is red and is so attractive !!	-1
1298	-1	 After that , it worked like a champ .	-1
1299	-1	 I find it too bright .	-1
1300	-1	 It has TV tuner , Composite inputs , DVI Input , SCART Input , Nice Speekers .	1
1301	-1	 5 .	-1
1302	-1	 If I buy something for me , I would consider to buy the same too .	-1
1303	-1	 If you are not picky about image quality , go for it .	-1
1304	-1	 Also one review said it does n't tilt ?	-1
1305	-1	 Great .	1
1306	-1	 I am really amazed that it can play 1080p movie flawlessly .	-1
1307	1	 The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .	1
1308	-1	 This unit replaced a broken display on a server with limited space .	-1
1309	-1	 You wo n't be disappointed with this netbook , and just encase you may want to purchase a Squaretrade warranty .	-1
1310	-1	 One last note , I purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states .	1
1311	-1	 Second gripe : In the 6 or so months since we purchased our batch of 30-40 of these monitors , 2 have already been returned for repair or replacement .	-1
1312	-1	 Icons show projected weather conditions and temperature ranges at a glance , along with the current outdoor temperature .	-1
1313	-1	 I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast .	-1
1314	-1	 I now have a Samsung which is great .	1
1315	-1	 -LRB- \* _ ~ -RRB-	-1
1316	-1	 The bundled iLife 05 alone elevates this computer from bargain PCs .	-1
1317	-1	 Angry that they did not even read the information that I had given on how to duplicate the problem .	-1
1318	-1	 I could tell this was a `` cheap '' monitor as soon as I set it up .	-1
1319	-1	 I do n't get all the negative reviews from so many others about this product .	-1
1320	1	 I exchanged this from an LG that I bought for nearly twice as much and the colors on the LG were not at all as nice as this .	-1
1321	1	 The keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable-although it does take some getting used to .	1
1322	1	 The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .	-1
1323	-1	 But when I finally got the monitor back , it still had the same issue and it also came back scratched on the bezel too .	-1
1324	-1	 Would definately recommend it .	-1
1325	1	 I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .	-1
1326	1	 The full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color .	-1
1327	-1	 Highly recommended .	-1
1328	-1	 1080p movie got no stutter or lag at all .	-1
1329	-1	 If this issues still being fixed by turning off and on the monitor , I guess I can deal with it , but I didnt paid the amount of money this babies cost to deal with this ... Shouldnt be that way .	-1
1330	-1	 I do n't get any anything reflections when the power is on .	-1
1331	1	 The colors are clear , also .	1
1332	1	 It 's so small , but big value Mac .	1
1333	-1	 I bought this monitor as an addition to my existing desktop monitor .	-1
1334	-1	 i 'm regular online shopper , i never had this bad experience in my life , this bring Question .	-1
1335	-1	 This is a well know problem with the PCs and Apple does not seem to care .	-1
1336	-1	 It does everything I want , especially on 1080p HD playback part .	-1
1337	-1	 Ok this is not a big issue anyway , 2 dots dont make a huge diferences , they are just annoying .	-1
1338	-1	 Then , I installed PotPlayer -LRB- install the 64bit version -RRB- on it .	-1
1339	-1	 I had been thinking a lot about changing my CRT montior to LCD monitor .	-1
1340	-1	 I sent my monitor in to Acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random Buzzing from my Acer GD235Hz monitor .	1
1341	-1	 lulz -RRB- .	-1
1342	1	 Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .	1
1343	-1	 While upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke .	-1
1344	-1	 is great but unfortunately I need it on paper .	1
1345	-1	 The included accompanying CD containing detailed information does not want to print out on my computer .	-1
1346	1	 My wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen .	-1
1347	1	 I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .	1
1348	-1	 A simple request , but impossible to fill !	-1
1349	-1	 son is on ipod all the time , wife watching tv on laptop , me online gaming on desktop -LRB- i did increase my bandwith from my internet provider when i did this -RRB- all at the same time and you would never know the difference if they werent .	-1
1350	-1	 X. X -RRB- into the browser address bar .	-1
1351	-1	 All I did was plug it in , print the ID\/password when prompted and download\/install the product dashboard -LRB- NetGennie ? -RRB-	-1
1352	1	 It has a USB port -- so you can plug in a USB-powered drive and have network-accessible storage .	-1
1353	-1	 I have applied to return this piece of garbage .	-1
1354	-1	 I highly recommend .	-1
1355	-1	 The default IP address from Buffalo Technologies was 192.168.11.1 for my device .	-1
1356	-1	 The new router worked well for 2 months after which it had failed .	-1
1357	1	 I 'm delighted with this product .	-1
1358	-1	 We did not use the software .	-1
1359	-1	 I must live in some sort of black hole as I have been through several different routers in attempts to have my wireless network up to the standard I believe it should be .	-1
1360	-1	 Experience this about 1-2 times a week .	-1
1361	-1	 I spent 4 hours on that and I could n't connect to the internet .	-1
1362	-1	 I know that many are very happy with this product , even those using Verizon FiOS , but just be aware that you may be as unlucky as I was .	-1
1363	-1	 It probably would have saved a phone call to their support line .	-1
1364	-1	 Since it was really a giveaway from Microsoft , I did n't expect much .	-1
1365	-1	 Called Netgear tech and they walked me through an additional lenghtly proceedure .	-1
1366	-1	 He was very patient with me .	-1
1367	-1	 If the DIR-655 does the auto-negotiation for you properly , then that 's great .	1
1368	-1	 The connection was smooth , did n't drop all the time , and was much faster .	-1
1369	-1	 I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .	-1
1370	1	 It was nice to have the faster internal network speeds while we tested this router -LRB- which was for all of about 3 hours while trying to get everything to work properly -RRB- .	-1
1371	-1	 Range was comparable to , or possibly slightly worse than the old Linksys router I had been using for years .	-1
1372	-1	 Sometimes the system would hang , so I would have to restart the router , then get going again .	-1
1373	-1	 I have an external usb drive hooked up to the USB interface as a Network Attached Storage -LRB- NAS -RRB- device .	-1
1374	-1	 x and 1.0.16 .	-1
1375	-1	 I set it up as best I could with the directions , but it seems like this device is not able to do repeater bridge at this time .	-1
1376	-1	 I bought this router not quite one year ago and am already shopping for it 's replacement .	-1
1377	1	 Setup was very easy .	1
1378	-1	 I actually have it sitting flat , rather than upright .	-1
1379	-1	 Neither computer could see the printer in the USB port .	-1
1380	-1	 No drops ... The only problem I have had so far is my Apple TV which was operating on the 5.0 Ghz signal .	-1
1381	1	 It was a snap to set up and my PS3 , ASUS EEE Netbook , Droid 2 , and PCs all connect without issue .	-1
1382	-1	 I really , really wanted to like the DIR-655 .	-1
1383	-1	 Intentional ?	-1
1384	-1	 This is a great buy as far as I know .	-1
1385	1	 I remain extremely pleased with this router !	1
1386	-1	 Way more features than I 'll ever use , but nice to know they 're there if I ever want to twiddle .	-1
1387	-1	 UPDATE 2011\/11\/15 : Smallnetbuilder dot com stuck with firmware version v1 .0.4.55 NA according to one of their articles that referenced the WNDR3700v1 test results .	-1
1388	-1	 You may ask why not go back to the old firmware .	-1
1389	-1	 I unplugged my new Nfinity G300N and moved it to a central location where I already had an ethernet jack installed .	-1
1390	1	 SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .	1
1391	-1	 It would have been four if I would n't have had to go through all of this hassle to get it to work right .	-1
1392	-1	 Did it work ?	-1
1393	-1	 I had the USB adapter for one computer and the express card for the laptop .	-1
1394	-1	 -LRB- lost internet connection with the router , internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem -RRB- .	-1
1395	-1	 Then go to `` Basic Settings '' subheading and change Wireless Network Name -LRB- SSID -RRB- to something you like .	-1
1396	-1	 -LRB- really -RRB- .	-1
1397	-1	 Now even 2.4 GHz Signals are NOT working .	-1
1398	-1	 Support suggested power problems .	-1
1399	-1	 Your router or modem has a LAN IP address and then will assign addresses to other devices on your network in a given range which means the second `` X '' referenced above will range between two numbers .	-1
1400	-1	 Then do a software reset again .	-1
1401	-1	 its a hit !	-1
1402	-1	 People have claimed that it is possible .	-1
1403	1	 However , if speed , reliability , and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements , then this router will do the job .	-1
1404	-1	 Our two requirements of a router were 1 -RRB- it should work with both Vista and 2000 and 2 -RRB- it should have a USB port so that we can connect the printer .	-1
1405	-1	 Well , not this box .	-1
1406	1	 I give it a rating of 5 stars for looks .	-1
1407	-1	 I was happy when I saw all my files and I was able to access them BUT when I tried to attach a document or file to an email , again I found you ca n't do this !	-1
1408	-1	 All of the resets and chasing upgrades were n't helping .	-1
1409	-1	 It is about 3 years old .	-1
1410	-1	 Probably like many others as I had no easy way to test the adapter .	1
1411	-1	 It is everything people had reviewed this to be .	-1
1412	-1	 This is just basic and so easily done - and will keep others from piggybacking , or worse yet , logging into your router and changing the settings and using their own login password to lock you out -LRB- if this has already happened you 'll need to Reset your router manually and start all over -RRB- .	-1
1413	-1	 A Windows Security window should open asking for a username and password that you previously setup to get into your primary router or modem setup software .	-1
1414	-1	 It had most every feature I wanted -LRB- though dual-band N would have been nice - one needs the much more expensive 855 for that -RRB- .	-1
1415	-1	 Unfortunately , I just could not get it to work .	-1
1416	-1	 Be prepared for a long wait -LRB- 30-45 minutes -RRB- , but the wait was worth it .	-1
1417	-1	 The laptop is one floor vertically and about 20 feet horizontally away from the router .	-1
1418	-1	 I am disappointed in this product .	-1
1419	-1	 Plug in the Nfinity G300N power and connect it to the computer with an ethernet cable .	-1
1420	-1	 I am in the process of upgrading to Windows 7 and find the network features much easier .	-1
1421	-1	 This worked -LRB- for a few days -RRB- Four days later , same failure .	-1
1422	-1	 The patch panel , switch , router , and modem are located in a panel in the basement where all my computer , video , and phone cables originate .	-1
1423	-1	 Same problem - no DHCP .	-1
1424	-1	 Advertised as D-link extreme over 300 mbs .	-1
1425	-1	 My old wireless G was having issues and dropping out .	-1
1426	-1	 SLOW GUI - Be prepared to wait approximately 90 seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded `` apply '' button ... yes , 1ï¿½1\/2 minutes !	-1
1427	1	 I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .	-1
1428	-1	 The 802.11 draft N-protocol made a huge difference from the Super-G which showed obselete in comparison .	-1
1429	-1	 Roku picked it up and all was done .	-1
1430	-1	 When I reset my WiFi HDTVs from the HDTVs , I assigned them to the 5.0 GHz band .	-1
1431	1	 It came well-packaged .	-1
1432	-1	 I wanted a device with good range , data transfer capacity , and security .	-1
1433	-1	 Now I have only been using this for a few days so this is a very early review .	-1
1434	-1	 So the solution I had to do was to make a copy of the image and documents onto my local computer in order to then upload .	-1
1435	-1	 Bottom Line - Do n't buy this for the USB function .	-1
1436	-1	 After my DLINK DI-614 + router died after 5 years , I bought my new router for a couple bucks less at Costco .	-1
1437	-1	 My experiences are as follows ... I wanted to upgrade my old linksys router -LRB- wrt54g -RRB- to something a little bit more on par with todays technology .	-1
1438	1	 As a Non-Technical person , I was surprised to install the Cisco Valet Plus Wireless Hotspot in less than 10 minutes .	-1
1439	1	 The set-up went fairly smooth with netgears online knowledge base .	-1
1440	-1	 I unplugged it , plugged it back in , and the power supply failed .	-1
1441	-1	 Everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically .	1
1442	1	 You can stop looking : This is the best n-router you will find today -LRB- I am writing this on 03 Nov 2011 -RRB- .	-1
1443	-1	 The only way I 'm able to access this usb drive is by going through the netgear genie through the ISP of the storage device .	-1
1444	1	 I have been dealing with wireless routers and access points for a long time -LRB- most recently with Cisco\/Linksys -RRB- and this was the easiest most efficient setup I 've ever experienced .	1
1445	-1	 This is a replacement to an older NetGear 11b\/g RangeMax router that i have had for a few years .	-1
1446	-1	 Again , I `` see '' too many who have n't set any type of security .	-1
1447	-1	 After about 5 hours of frustration I did not feel any love for these choices .	-1
1448	-1	 Edit : December 2008 .	-1
1449	1	 This device solves the problem nicely .	-1
1450	-1	 You ca n't , that `` upgrade '' is irreversible .	-1
1451	-1	 Easy enough but it did not work .	-1
1452	-1	 2 .	-1
1453	-1	 I read most of the reviews and checked out others before I bought this one .	-1
1454	-1	 The `` Local DNS IP '' address will be all zeros in most cases .	-1
1455	-1	 ... what a shame !	-1
1456	1	 After much frustration , I finally upgraded the firmware to the latest DD-WRT firmware at DD-WRT 's website and it resolved all my problems .	-1
1457	-1	 Click `` Apply Settings . ''	-1
1458	-1	 We 'll see how it goes .	-1
1459	-1	 Not only that , but you ca n't even use the trial demo on macs - in order make printer sharing work , you have to buy the full version for macs -LRB- but not for PCs -RRB- .	-1
1460	-1	 with the NetGear WNR3500L .	-1
1461	1	 However the setup was easy and the results excellent .	1
1462	-1	 In my case , I clicked on `` Status '' and then on `` System Data . ''	-1
1463	-1	 I bought this one for the supposed extended range and external antenna .	-1
1464	-1	 On my first attempt , I assigned a static IP that was outside the range of my primary router so I had to go into my router setup and change my router 's range so my router could `` see '' the Nfinity Wireless Access Point .	-1
1465	1	 The set-up is goof-proof , and offers a superior result .	-1
1466	-1	 The data rate over the network storage is rather slow , but I only use it for occasional backups so it does n't bother me too much .	-1
1467	-1	 I did n't have to call customer care , I followed the wizard , and it was fairly easy .	1
1468	-1	 It turns out my Apple laptop recognizes the wireless router right out of the box with no installation needed .	-1
1469	-1	 Type the IP address for Nfinity 's setup page .	-1
1470	-1	 I purchased this Netgear router 6 months ago to replace an older model Linksys router with antennas , which had replaced an even older Linksys , also with antennas .	-1
1471	-1	 So if you are trying to use this router with two different operating systems , set it up using the computer that has the newest OS and you 'll hopefully be successful .	-1
1472	-1	 I bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless N speeds .	-1
1473	-1	 Type in your own SSID -LRB- name -RRB- - do n't leave it at the Default name .	-1
1474	-1	 This is THE router for those who want to save some $ $ $ by not ` renting ' from a cable firm .	-1
1475	1	 I would n't mind having an external adjustable antenna , but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved .	-1
1476	-1	 1 .	-1
1477	1	 I verified the signal strengths with a laptop and there was no problem there .	-1
1478	-1	 What happened to everything between 1.0.7 .	-1
1479	-1	 I have been using this router for about 2 years now , since October 2008 .	-1
1480	-1	 I 'm not a networking expert by any means -RRB- .	-1
1481	-1	 The solutions that worked seemed to involve black magic or pure luck , as they would work for one person would not work for another .	-1
1482	-1	 And now , Netgear has deleted their customer service number from their website .	-1
1483	1	 I personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets .	-1
1484	1	 The set up for this product was a breeze .	-1
1485	-1	 I loaded that with the following ritual : Hold reset switch 30 seconds with power on -LRB- still 1.0.16.98-dnsNA firmware -RRB- .	-1
1486	-1	 It does everything it says .	-1
1487	-1	 Owned for 2.5 months and never had to reset yet .	-1
1488	1	 Best tech support I have ever experienced .	-1
1489	-1	 The customer support is very rude .	-1
1490	-1	 The router would close any open connection after about 2 minutes , meaning that telnet\/ssh and numerous games would suddenly disconnect .	-1
1491	-1	 This router replaced an aging Linksys WRT54G .	-1
1492	-1	 This router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed IPTV from Hulu Plus would slow down and freeze or stutter .	-1
1493	1	 At first I dealt with this as 18mbps was still REALLY fast .	-1
1494	1	 So far the router has worked well .	-1
1495	-1	 Commputer , Laptop and TV hooked up to it .	-1
1496	-1	 First , I have what I consider an average understanding of computers and home network technology .	-1
1497	-1	 This is my experience , and it seems to be a common one .	-1
1498	1	 When I then moved the wire to the desktop and used the laptop wirelessly , the internet connection was just fine .	-1
1499	-1	 More than likely , if you are forking over the money for this router , you have higher needs and expectations , which this router does n't meet .	-1
1500	-1	 Windows 7 : Click the `` start '' icon in the lower left corner -RRB- control panel -RRB- Network and Internet -RRB- Network and Sharing Center -RRB- and then click `` See full map '' under the heading `` View your basic network information and setup connections . ''	-1
1501	-1	 However , the day the replacement router arrived , things got complicated .	-1
1502	-1	 Guest Network .	-1
1503	-1	 Since it would not work as advertised I called support .	-1
1504	-1	 Cisco-Linksys leaves serial numbers on refurbs and give them limited warranties .	-1
1505	-1	 The computers never could see the USB port .	-1
1506	-1	 When I bought the third one , I thought I can give D-link one more try , but now I regret my decision .	-1
1507	-1	 Just getting a little old .	-1
1508	-1	 So , I looked on line to buy one and guess what ?	-1
1509	-1	 Fortunately they mentioned this to me -LRB- before just buying another router -RRB- and I helped them get back online .	-1
1510	-1	 Works -LRB- almost -RRB- exactly as advertised .	1
1511	1	 Even works better on G band than the Linksys .	-1
1512	-1	 Purchased this on Amazon .	-1
1513	-1	 We wanted to find a better solution .	-1
1514	-1	 Netgear refused to diagnose the WNR3500L without a fee because I was repeating an older NETGEAR router .	-1
1515	1	 The DIR-655 was so easy to setup it was almost too easy .	1
1516	-1	 The tech continued however to try to make it work .	-1
1517	1	 It has very good range -- much better than the Linksys router it replaced .	1
1518	-1	 With the WNDR37AV I now get full bars in every room , through four walls -LRB- metal stud construction -RRB- except in the garage which gets almost full bars .	-1
1519	-1	 Exasperated at 3 AM , I called it quits and will be sending this awful , deceptive product back .	-1
1520	-1	 EXTERNAL SWITCH -LRB- AUTO MODE -RRB- - It 's advertised as a router and wireless access point .	-1
1521	-1	 Since it was Sunday , was very skeptical .	-1
1522	-1	 Moreover , I found it to be more user friendly than the old Linksys I had .	-1
1523	-1	 My husband and I are both software engineers .	-1
1524	1	 Setup was easy -LRB- Windows XP wired , Windows 7 Professional wifi -RRB- .	1
1525	-1	 On the recommendation of several friends and positive reviews , I picked up the WNDR3700 .	-1
1526	1	 No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .	1
1527	-1	 On a wired connection with my linksys , speedtest.net rated my home pc with a connection of up to 25mbps connection and wireless speeds around 15 mbps .	-1
1528	-1	 I am a long time D-Link customer -LRB- owned 3 different D-link routers -RRB- , the last two all failed in one year .	-1
1529	-1	 I have several computers on my network -LRB- iMac , mac book , and 2 XP laptops -RRB- , my ipod , airport , wireless printer and a NAS with two 500GB HD 's .	-1
1530	-1	 However , you may not want to be without a router for the time it takes them to replace this -LRB- if you buy it -RRB- when it fails .	-1
1531	-1	 HUGE CON : While I was in the setup screen one day to double check my wireless network password , I noticed that a link had appeared announcing the presence of a firmware upgrade .	-1
1532	-1	 I tried changing wireless encryption , updating to the latest firmware from Buffalo 's site , and then upgrading the latest firmware from dd-wrt 's site .	-1
1533	-1	 In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .	-1
1534	-1	 Should have bought the Linksys routers , no more D-link for me .	-1
1535	1	 PROS : So off I went to get a faster router , and this one did the job I bought it for admirably .	-1
1536	-1	 I read reports of a European firmware update that resolved the problem for some , but it did n't for me .	-1
1537	-1	 Can even use the power button if laptops are booted and our internet connection is almost immediate .	-1
1538	-1	 Keep that in mind with respect to my evaluation of this product .	-1
1539	-1	 Scroll further down to `` Network Address Server Settings -LRB- DHCP -RRB- '' and make sure that the DHCP server is `` disabled . ''	-1
1540	-1	 Also , our previous wireless router was SLOW and unreliable .	-1
1541	-1	 My attempts at upgrading using Netgear Genie corrupted the existing firmware .	-1
1542	-1	 Still no luck .	-1
1543	-1	 So much for range though .	-1
1544	-1	 I have had no problems with it yet , and I can us my ipod anywhere in the house .	-1
1545	-1	 First , I tried to set the router up using the wire connection to the old desktop .	-1
1546	-1	 I installed it directly from Windows 7 in about three minutes .	-1
1547	-1	 It might be good for that .	-1
1548	-1	 8 .	-1
1549	-1	 I did n't change any of the QOS or WAN settings .	-1
1550	-1	 No dice .	-1
1551	-1	 I looked at the wifi hotspot type products but most of those require a 1-2 year contact and can cost up to $ 40-60 per month for the data service which adds up fast over a 12 month period .	-1
1552	-1	 Setup required one phone call to tech support , during which it was determined that I had not completely re-set my cable modem -LRB- it has a backup battery , so simply disconnecting the power cord was n't enough - I had to remove the backup battery , too -RRB- .	-1
1553	1	 And it 's sleek and sexy looking as well .	1
1554	-1	 If not , you can install a switch or look for another brand .	-1
1555	-1	 This model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned .	-1
1556	-1	 Make sure the ethernet cable is plugged into Nfinity 's LAN port and not the WAN -LRB- blue -RRB- port .	-1
1557	-1	 I 'm guessing that he was actually located within the U.S. which I almost consider a bonus since so much technical support is overseas .	-1
1558	-1	 We purchased this so we could have guests use their laptops and iPods in our home .	-1
1559	1	 It 's a really nice looking device and can be positioned horizontally or vertically .	1
1560	1	 My blu-ray player and WD Live TV box normally lean back , smile , and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade , and perform well forever thereafter .	-1
1561	1	 You should use the firmware on the DD-WRT website instead .	-1
1562	-1	 The wrong router was in the box -LRB- new not refurb -RRB- .	-1
1563	-1	 That is absurd and downright deceptive .	-1
1564	-1	 Once you login to the router 's address , you 'll find it listed under Maintenance at Set Password .	-1
1565	-1	 5 .	-1
1566	-1	 In another 6 mos they will surely come out with a router that will do 2000 mbps -LRB- not that they do n't already have it , they just do n't want to release it , , , , yet -RRB- and everybody will run to get one .	-1
1567	-1	 The software said the unit had the wrong serial number , and the wrong model .	-1
1568	-1	 At this point I had no idea they had put the wrong unit in the box .	-1
1569	1	 Piece of cake to set up .	-1
1570	-1	 The second-level support rep had me change the speed to 10Mbps -LRB- instead of the default 10\/100\/1000 auto -RRB- and it worked .	-1
1571	-1	 1.28 .	-1
1572	-1	 Using the same MAC address did n't help , neither did making sure the IP was released from the old router before connecting the new one .	-1
1573	-1	 I am lucky to have bought it and using it in my house Thanks Ihsan	-1
1574	1	 Amazing speed and easy to set up .	1
1575	-1	 Finally got around to installing my Cisco-Valet .	-1
1576	-1	 There 's no getting around it .	-1
1577	-1	 However the `` X. X '' are different between home networks and `` X '' may generally be one , two , or three digit numbers .	-1
1578	-1	 The unit came with the DD-WRT firmware dated from last August .	-1
1579	-1	 Not so safe .	-1
1580	-1	 Addition on 4\/14\/2011 \*\*\* I 've just had the 2nd router of this model go bad inside of 5 months .	-1
1581	1	 I was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup .	-1
1582	-1	 It turns out my Apple laptop recognizes the wireless router right out of the box with no installation needed .	-1
1583	-1	 This happens when my laptop is the only computer on its network .	-1
1584	-1	 I have learned a great deal about Netgear 's warranty policy through this experience , and will avoid this brand at all costs .	1
1585	-1	 Still holding , turn power on .	-1
1586	-1	 It had become well and truly a door stop .	-1
1587	-1	 Here I had major problems - no one should have to wade through complicated terminology like WEP and WAP and lord knows what else just to enable a simple password protection for a home network .	-1
1588	-1	 Boot up , leave on for at least two minutes , and do software factory reset -LRB- from backup menu in web GUI -RRB- .	-1
1589	-1	 It will depend on who makes your router or modem but there should be something like a `` status '' menu option .	-1
1590	1	 Update : I 've been using this router for 3 months and it 's still working very well - wifi remains strong and consistant .	1
1591	-1	 The old router has worked well for going on two years .	-1
1592	-1	 Half my neighbors have not .	-1
1593	-1	 I hope I accurately captured my notes from my call to Buffalo Technologies and that you find my notes helpful .	-1
1594	-1	 I 'm running a minimal configuration , nothing fancy beyond password protecting the wireless .	-1
1595	1	 The software on the router is pretty good .	1
1596	-1	 Then turn power off and let go of reset switch and wait 10 seconds .	-1
1597	-1	 The answer was yes .	-1
1598	-1	 As far as performance my very old Linksys 54g worked fine with a strong signal and a solid 54 mbps wireless .	1
1599	-1	 Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .	-1
1600	-1	 I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .	-1
1601	-1	 It covers three floors with no difficulty .	-1
1602	1	 I spent 1.5 hours on the phone with their Tech Support -LRB- you get connected right away and do n't have to wait -RRB- and got at least my iMac and MacBook back online .	-1
1603	-1	 -LRB- I use verizon DSL and discovered that I needed to go through some steps before the router would be recognized by my ISP . -RRB-	-1
1604	-1	 After that , the router would never even respond to its own internal browser link .	-1
1605	1	 Very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position .	1
1606	-1	 This part confused me as I could n't find how to set your security parameters .	-1
1607	-1	 Now I am thinking either buy the expensive warranty or buy another router .	-1
1608	-1	 I have owned this for over 6 months and have never had to reset it due to instability .	-1
1609	1	 Made call which was immediately answered by very helpful , competent tech .	-1
1610	-1	 -LRB- Wireshark shows what seems to me to be an excessive amount of ARP requests .	-1
1611	-1	 I set up the 2.4 GHz radio as G -LRB- 54Mb\/s -RRB- with WEP , the 5GHz radio as N single band -LRB- 130Mb\/s -RRB- , WPA2 Personal AES .	-1
1612	-1	 You can probably set it up for 300Mb\/s -LRB- double wide -RRB- if you want .	-1
1613	-1	 I just got this Netgear to replace an Pre-N Belkin .	-1
1614	-1	 It just was n't worth it and so I 've had to live with the problem -LRB- infrequent as it is -RRB- .	-1
1615	1	 They deliver great 5.1 sound when hooked up and ACTUALLY RECEIVING A 5.1 SIGNAL .	1
1616	-1	 These are more suitable for hip hop or rock , the dialogue sounds unnatural and piano music sounds like MIDI -LRB- lol -RRB- .	-1
1617	-1	 I use them with music coming from my computer .	-1
1618	-1	 The box was the size of a large boombox , and I would occasionally peer about me on the way home , partially wondering when I was going to get jacked for the speaker !	-1
1619	-1	 So , I traded my Prius in for a 1975 Dodge Dart -LRB- with a built in 8-track - I knew these cables would make that ROCK -RRB- and chose expedited shipping .	-1
1620	-1	 I was super excited to receive this little speaker .	-1
1621	-1	 One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .	-1
1622	1	 These are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park .	1
1623	1	 For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .	1
1624	-1	 The buttons are confusing and super small .	-1
1625	-1	 Because of that though , I am tempted to send it back .	-1
1626	-1	 I also disagree that this system sounds like a boombox .	-1
1627	1	 I love this speakers .	1
1628	-1	 I thought Aunt Loretta had sent them .	-1
1629	-1	 You can control each S5 player seperately , what music and what volume , tone , pause etc , all independent of other players !	-1
1630	-1	 What it really is , is a pouch with speaker - the zippers open up a little bucket for your sunglasses and your cell phone inside .	1
1631	-1	 I will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker .	-1
1632	1	 Volume level is OK .	-1
1633	-1	 Not bad overall .	-1
1634	1	 - If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .	-1
1635	1	 These a great speakers - full of sound .	1
1636	-1	 It sounds great !	1
1637	-1	 \* It will automatically pair , and now you can play music .	-1
1638	-1	 Both provide a docking port for the iPod\/iPhone on the top panel .	-1
1639	-1	 The speakers actually sound like speakers , average speakers though .	-1
1640	1	 The Center channel is JBL - S - Center II , this unit is very powerful and produces crystal clear dialogues , and it 's a 3-way speaker system .	1
1641	1	 I didnt want one in which I would have to put in batteries myself -LRB- that is a pain -RRB- I did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and im glad I purchased these speakers .	-1
1642	-1	 The range of response seems a little limited to me -LRB- changing the EQ setting on the iPod produces a definite change in the sound , but I would expect a little more richness in the changes -RRB- .	-1
1643	-1	 However , I am still a little disappointed when you come down to the overall feeling I get from the purchase .	-1
1644	1	 : - -LRB- All that being said , the speakers have good sound quality .	1
1645	-1	 The subwoofer of the corsair is miles ahead of the Klipsh .	-1
1646	-1	 I 'm now shopping for new speaker and when I saw that they were still available I just wanted to see what other folks were saying about them ... WOW , I 'm not alone !	-1
1647	-1	 I have a realtek soundcard and found it in the control panel under the name `` sound effects manager . ''	-1
1648	-1	 Period .	-1
1649	1	 If you want a quality product , delivered on time , buy this one .	-1
1650	1	 and the sound well there is no complaints about that .	-1
1651	-1	 The word `` amazing '' even comes to mind .	-1
1652	1	 The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .	1
1653	-1	 I had the Klipsh promedia speakers before the corsair 2500 also and I can tell you the klipsh does not compare at all to the corsair .	-1
1654	-1	 Go to Harmon on line to see better instructions if needed .	-1
1655	-1	 First , i was looking for an iPhone dock and FM tuner , not necessarily an alarm clock - as its for the office .	-1
1656	-1	 - Construction : all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last .	-1
1657	-1	 The iDevice is then accessed to change songs .	-1
1658	1	 All I can say is that this is an excellent devise .	1
1659	-1	 After reading many reviews about X230 , I ordered it -LRB- through office depot for 34 bucks and free shipping which only took 2 days with UPS -RRB- .	-1
1660	1	 Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .	1
1661	-1	 I had purchased a black one some time ago that I was also crazy about so I bought this to have with my other devices .	-1
1662	1	 Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .	1
1663	1	 They are very sturdy , and have no trouble balance wise , or handling oddly shaped speakers .	1
1664	-1	 They worked in the beginning ... then something fried inside the sub ... returned them , got new ones ... Same thing happened ... now they are unuseable .	-1
1665	-1	 You will probally also need to setup the sound card to use 5.1 sound .	-1
1666	-1	 If you do n't have the smaller size Sandisk MP3 -LRB- mine is bigger than the series the dock is designed for -RRB- , the player does not fit in the dock , but it jacked into the audio input with a cord that is included .	-1
1667	-1	 So it all comes together .	-1
1668	1	 Great speakers overall .	1
1669	1	 - Sub woofer is large .	-1
1670	-1	 I always obsess about researching others reviews before I pull the trigger , especially when it comes to electronics or books .	-1
1671	1	 Apart from being very easy to install , and the excellent music quality , what I really find fascinating is discovering new artists with Internet radio stations or music providers .	1
1672	-1	 I have a very small laptop computer .	1
1673	-1	 I 've been surprised at how many uses I 've found for it , I 've used it with my laptop in the kitchen , and attached to my iphone 4 , I 've used it in the car , put it on the ledge in the kitchen above the sink and watched movies while doing the dishes , and carried it from room to room while I 've listened to Pandora .	-1
1674	-1	 I 'm big on trying anything before I buy it .	-1
1675	-1	 Which brings me to the next point : this is advertised as being for small laptops and netbooks that are 14 '' and under in size , and that is certainly true .	-1
1676	-1	 I purchased this phone set for work , thinking that inexpensive replacement phones would ease the pain of things being spilled on them or dropped .	-1
1677	-1	 Both , at the touch of a button , start playing music from the content of the iDevice .	-1
1678	-1	 I 'm breaking them in with some trance at a moderate volume right now .	-1
1679	-1	 They can be easily damaged if poked .	-1
1680	-1	 The sound quality has been poor since day one , the base constantly drops calls , and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base -- we can no longer use the AC adapter with the base or it turns off completely .	-1
1681	-1	 I am a very pleased customer .	1
1682	-1	 Most of our listening is at modest volumes , but I have turned them up on some demanding tracks and they do n't flinch .	-1
1683	-1	 So -- before ordering , consider what you will use them for .	-1
1684	-1	 All in all , could n't be more happy with the purchase .	-1
1685	1	 Portable .	-1
1686	-1	 I am sure that my appreciation of fine music would never have developed were it not for the audiophile quality sound that these cables were able to extract from my little Fischer-Price phonograph .	-1
1687	1	 Awesome sound system .	-1
1688	-1	 Seriously , I had to turn it down !	-1
1689	-1	 I replaced the speaker with an ebay purchase and hope that will be the only replacement I have to worry about for a while .	-1
1690	1	 I have no problem at all recommending these stands .	-1
1691	-1	 The front sound comes directly from the front of the TV as sound should .	-1
1692	-1	 I use them to protect my legs from the heat output as well as for comfort .	-1
1693	1	 This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .	1
1694	-1	 They are seamless when looking at them straight on , but at side and 3\/4 views -LRB- pictures that were not available on line -RRB- the rear of the speaker is visible .	-1
1695	1	 You can fill a small room with sound pretty good , but do n't think it rivals a home theater system .	1
1696	-1	 On a scale of 1-10 I would say it is a 2 at best .	-1
1697	-1	 You pay for what you get .	-1
1698	1	 A great system at an incredible price .	1
1699	-1	 I never needed a password .	-1
1700	-1	 I do wish they came with mounting screws for the speakers .	-1
1701	-1	 This would be great in a dorm room or bedroom setting where you may not already have a stereo receiver and want better sound than what your TV is giving you .	-1
1702	-1	 These were the cables from my youth .	-1
1703	-1	 I 'm part of the group that has had no luck with these .	-1
1704	-1	 The only connection the S5 units require is an electrical outlet , rest is wireless unless you need to connect it to a router -LRB- no Bridge -RRB- or you have something to input via jack in back -LRB- ipod -RRB- .	-1
1705	-1	 I could n't beleive what I purchased after I received the item .	-1
1706	-1	 I must say : - IT WORKS WITH IPHONE4 , EVEN WITH THIN CASE ON IT .	-1
1707	-1	 I would think that a quality system like this would have come with at least 18 or 16 guage wire .	-1
1708	-1	 There are a few things that I do n't like about the design .	-1
1709	-1	 I just wish I had n't ruined them by hooking them onto my bicycle spokes with a clothespin .	-1
1710	-1	 Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are n't that great .	1
1711	-1	 Well , except for the fact that I bus to work\/home , so when it arrived at my work , I was carrying a 25 lb .	-1
1712	1	 Very good value for the money .	1
1713	1	 This is one of the nicest electronic devices that I 've ever owned .	-1
1714	1	 Had a JVC system that was 6 years old and I thought it was good , but the Onkyo sound is amazing !	1
1715	1	 The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .	1
1716	-1	 A small cosmetic issue , but good to know .	1
1717	1	 It was easy to install all of the components and directions were easy to understand , even for an old guy like me .	1
1718	1	 Sounds awesome .	-1
1719	-1	 The only issue was what model to get ... I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the E60s and E80s .	-1
1720	-1	 The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .	-1
1721	-1	 I very rarely review any type of electronic devise , so I 'm sort of in uncharted territory here .	-1
1722	-1	 - Games and video can sound very tinny if you do n't do some adjustments on the software end when you switch from music .	-1
1723	-1	 The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .	-1
1724	-1	 Seems to be durable enough but I 've only had it a few weeks so we 'll see .	-1
1725	1	 Love this speaker .	1
1726	-1	 I 'm a college kid , recreational audiophile and bass fanatic , studying engineering .	-1
1727	1	 A + + + + + + product and very well built for apple users in mind ... ... oh yeah theres a usb port in the back for you droid people .	-1
1728	-1	 : -RRB- P.S. BTW , the robbery never occurred , I got home safe and sound ...	-1
1729	-1	 I broke this in for more than 400 hours , not continuously or course .	-1
1730	-1	 I have my TV 's tuner connected to the optical and my HTPC connected to the coax , and I mostly use the computer to watch recordings .	-1
1731	-1	 When I saw these cables , I could n't have been more excited .	-1
1732	1	 Music sounds great but having surround sound in game is nice and a big difference from headphones .	1
1733	-1	 I just do n't want this .	-1
1734	-1	 My wife who really could care less about thees things was impressed I do n't think I will ever go to the movie theater again .	-1
1735	-1	 No complaints there .	-1
1736	-1	 Logitech have a way of seeing what is needed in any given area and bringing it to fruition .	-1
1737	-1	 Ulrich Schnauss , Bonobo , DJ Shadow , Busta , Snoop , E40 , Louis Armstrong , Michael Jackson , Bach , Korn , Metallica , Hoobastank , 311 .	-1
1738	1	 These speakers are great .	1
1739	-1	 I almost always use one with both my netbook and my laptop .	-1
1740	-1	 The big difference in the two units , beyond their appearance , is in sound quality .	1
1741	-1	 I have not had any of the bad issues that I saw in other reviews , and we are very pleased with the purchase .	-1
1742	-1	 All of my music outputs in 2\/2 .1 at best except for some FLAC files , but it puts out the sound for Skyrim , movies with the proper audio data , and other similar media with a lot of quality .	-1
1743	-1	 I decided to give them a chance and I 've gotten a little more used to them .	-1
1744	1	 it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand .	1
1745	-1	 Bought the Klipsch 2.1 and found them clearly superior to these .	-1
1746	-1	 They start to go when you hear the light crackling ... then it moves into the bass distortion mode ... now they just hum loudly with intermitent loud crackling .	-1
1747	1	 Once I turn up the volume a touch , they sound really good .	1
1748	-1	 I ordered Harmon Kardon Soundstick II and I returned them .	-1
1749	1	 It also has a 10 year warranty , which is just icing on the cake .	-1
1750	-1	 The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .	-1
1751	1	 Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .	1
1752	1	 Other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and I would still purchase this all over again .	-1
1753	1	 Great Sound .	1
1754	1	 The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .	-1
1755	1	 Billy Joel was n't kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers .	-1
1756	1	 I 'm not easily impressed by electronics , tending to be a little conservative , but this product really deserves five stars .	-1
1757	-1	 Both units have an alarm clock capability , with the iPod\/iPhone utilized for the musical accompaniment .	-1
1758	-1	 I 'm A + if anyone is interested .	-1
1759	1	 I absolutely LOVE these speakers .	1
1760	-1	 Its not a big deal for me .	-1
1761	-1	 My only wish would be that these would 've been made in the USA rather than China , but at least the company is still mostly based here .	-1
1762	-1	 You understand ?	-1
1763	-1	 It is also a bit bigger than expected but that 's OK because all I need is something to work with my iphone .	-1
1764	1	 This product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx501 to my Toyota camry 2001 mode .	1
1765	-1	 Enjoy enjoy enjoy the best !	-1
1766	1	 I highly recommend this device !	1
1767	1	 This is the best speaker mount I had so far .	1
1768	-1	 just push it into the slot - It charges the iPhone4 .	-1
1769	-1	 They used a glossy finish on the front .	-1
1770	-1	 Great gift for any one !	1
1771	1	 However , once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work I like to get done with some background music , viola , the audio is great -LRB- well , this is relative - great for a computer speaker -RRB- .	1
1772	-1	 However , the Bose station did not fill the 3 room basement as we wanted so I started searching new speakers .	-1
1773	-1	 Highly recommended .	-1
1774	-1	 If you are hosting a party and want music to play throughout your house , this would be a great option as well .	-1
1775	-1	 They rate better as well , 4.5 stars compared to 4 stars , with NO 1 star reviews .	-1
1776	1	 - Tuner quality is good .	1
1777	-1	 This product is a must have , believe I did my research .	-1
1778	-1	 But I wanted something that I can play without having to plug into a power outlet and would work on rechargable batteries .	-1
1779	-1	 They use a design that has a passive radiator that takes up most of the back of each speaker .	-1
1780	-1	 There are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built-in speaker crossovers .	-1
1781	1	 If you 're looking for a quality tower speaker ... this is it .	-1
1782	-1	 The sound quality is very poor .	1
1783	-1	 So think hard and shop around before you jump on the Bose name , or better yet , if you can , try them out first .	-1
1784	-1	 I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !	-1
1785	-1	 It is what you would expect for a ~ $ 30 dock .	-1
1786	1	 The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!	-1
1787	-1	 Buy Them ...	-1
1788	-1	 If your computer is anything like mine , you will need to get a different cord , in a `` Y '' shape , where the `` top '' of the `` Y '' are 2 RCA male connectors -LRB- these plug into the speakers -RRB- , and the `` bottom '' of the `` Y '' is a single male headphone jack connector -LRB- this plugs into your computer -RRB- .	-1
1789	-1	 What I do n't like is that at lower volume music listening , tonal qualities are very poor .	-1
1790	1	 For the price there 's nothing better .	-1
1791	1	 The build quality is top notch .	1
1792	1	 Lastly , I feel that the speakers were over priced for what I got -LRB- unless there is some inherent benefit in the Bose label that I do n't know of -RRB- .	-1
1793	1	 The bass is solid and can be quite impressive if turned up .	-1
1794	1	 Works great !	1
1795	-1	 While the netbook is small enough to leave room for an external mouse , there really is n't enough room for it with my laptop , which is 14 '' .	-1
1796	1	 In addition the price point is spectacular .	-1
1797	-1	 It effortlessly filled by medium-sized room with sound .	-1
1798	-1	 Warning : These speakers are marketed as speakers for your TV , PlayStation , or DVD player -- not your computer .	-1
1799	1	 The speakers perform very well , and with the bass boost , the sound fills outs exceedingly well .	1
1800	-1	 Enclosed were the instructions , a wall mounting bracket , and a bracket for placing the speaker on a shelf .	-1
1801	-1	 I own two of these and I have configured these as my front left & right speakers .	-1
1802	1	 Pros : - Great sound for a $ 100 speaker at mid to higher levels .	1
1803	-1	 But it is better .	-1
1804	-1	 I got mine quick , everything works fine , botta boom botta bing .	1
1805	1	 Still for the price you ca n't find better for the cost .	1
1806	-1	 I was doubtful that this device would be able to do anything helpful for my laptop , but it virtually turned my laptop into a stereo system !	-1
1807	-1	 Both then sync with the device so as to display the time .	-1
1808	-1	 My only complaint , is that the cord is not long enough .	-1
1809	-1	 They are a bit top heavy , as any tower will be .	-1
1810	-1	 Before this I had the jbl on stage , which were also incredibly good .	-1
1811	-1	 Within seconds the confirmation email arrived .	-1
1812	1	 Very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality .	1
1813	1	 Vocals have greater clarity with the iHome as well .	-1
1814	-1	 It only bother 's me when i want the laptop in my lap so i need the screen down a little but this device pulls it way back down .	-1
1815	-1	 I can listen to my albums again , is crazy , good luck !	-1
1816	-1	 But , adjusting the picture settings is a one time thing for most people .	-1
1817	1	 If I were to rate these speakers on my listening needs , I would give a 2.5 stars , but I 'm giving 4 because I think they do the job that most people want them for .	-1
1818	1	 The sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca n't hear a thing .	-1
1819	-1	 When I first listened to the XtremeMac , I thought there was only a single speaker .	-1
1820	-1	 Save you 're money and keep shopping .	-1
1821	-1	 And now I do n't think I can go back to the old school stereo again .	-1
1822	1	The included software removes any red eye easily.	-1
1823	1	All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.	-1
1824	-1	Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.	-1
1825	1	turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.	-1
1826	-1	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.	-1
1827	-1	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.	-1
1828	-1	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.	-1
1829	1	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!	1
1830	-1	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.	-1
1831	1	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.	-1
1832	-1	"I use ""get ready"" and ""here it comes""."	-1
1833	1	 am so glad I bought this camera.	-1
1834	-1	You will not be dissapointed!	-1
1835	-1	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.	-1
1836	-1	Some more manual control would have been nice.	-1
1837	1	This camera is bulletproof.	1
1838	-1	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.	-1
1839	1	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.	-1
1840	1	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.	-1
1841	-1	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.	1
1842	-1	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.	-1
1843	-1	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099	-1
1844	1	And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.	1
1845	1	I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.	1
1846	-1	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.	-1
1847	-1	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.	-1
1848	1	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.	-1
1849	-1	More detail. More natural color.	-1
1850	-1	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.	-1
1851	1	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.	1
1852	1	I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.	1
1853	1	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!	-1
1854	1	This camera is truely superb.	1
1855	-1	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.	-1
1856	-1	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.	-1
1857	-1	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.	-1
1858	-1	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.	-1
1859	1	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.	-1
1860	-1	But believe me, it's well worth it.	-1
1861	-1	Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.	1
1862	1	"Very good ""every day"" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos."	1
1863	1	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.	1
1864	1	Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.	1
1865	1	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.	1
1866	1	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.	-1
1867	-1	Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).	-1
1868	1	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.	1
1869	1	The camera responce is VERY quick.	1
1870	1	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.	1
1871	-1	I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.	-1
1872	-1	It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office  where no one goes but me.	-1
1873	1	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.	1
1874	1	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.	1
1875	1	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.	1
1876	1	Good image quality.	-1
1877	-1	Stored in a padded case.	-1
1878	1	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.	1
1879	-1	"Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the ""digital"" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera."	1
1880	-1	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.	-1
1881	-1	The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark.	-1
1882	1	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.	1
1883	1	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)	1
1884	-1	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.	-1
1885	-1	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.	-1
1886	-1	And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.	-1
1887	-1	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.	-1
1888	-1	The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.	-1
1889	1	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!	-1
1890	-1	Who knows maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.	-1
1891	-1	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.	-1
1892	-1	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.	-1
1893	-1	Why did I wait so long?  detail[-1],color rendition[-1][cc]	-1
1894	1	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.	1
1895	1	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:	-1
1896	-1	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...	-1
1897	-1	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.	-1
1898	1	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.	-1
1899	1	There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.	-1
1900	1	This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:	-1
1901	-1	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !	-1
1902	-1	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.	-1
1903	1	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.	1
1904	1	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.	1
1905	-1	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.	-1
1906	-1	Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.	-1
1907	1	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.	-1
1908	1	5- Excelent software package.	-1
1909	1	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!	-1
1910	-1	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.	-1
1911	1	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.	1
1912	1	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.	1
1913	1	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.	1
1914	-1	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.	-1
1915	-1	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.	-1
1916	1	It fits in your pocket.	1
1917	-1	Fool proof.	-1
1918	1	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.	1
1919	-1	I have had this little gem for four months now.	-1
1920	-1	Good quality and fun!	1
1921	-1	I said, can your fancy camera do that?	-1
1922	1	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.	-1
1923	-1	The included battery charger is larger!	-1
1924	-1	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.	-1
1925	-1	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.	-1
1926	-1	Here are some useful facts:-	-1
1927	-1	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.	-1
1928	-1	While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.	-1
1929	-1	I wrote another review and this is the update.	-1
1930	-1	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.	-1
1931	-1	The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.	-1
1932	1	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)	-1
1933	1	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.	-1
1934	1	The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).	1
1935	-1	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.	-1
1936	1	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.	1
1937	1	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.	-1
1938	-1	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,	-1
1939	-1	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:	-1
1940	-1	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.	1
1941	1	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.	1
1942	1	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.	-1
1943	-1	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.	-1
1944	1	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.	-1
1945	1	Hate to wait between shots	-1
1946	-1	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.	-1
1947	1	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.	-1
1948	-1	I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.	-1
1949	-1	If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?	-1
1950	-1	BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.	-1
1951	1	This camera is so easy to use!	1
1952	-1	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.	-1
1953	1	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.	-1
1954	1	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.	-1
1955	-1	Very wrong.	-1
1956	-1	Definitely a good investment.	-1
1957	1	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.	1
1958	-1	I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.	-1
1959	-1	got this as it flew off the shelves.	-1
1960	1	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.	1
1961	-1	I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.	-1
1962	-1	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.	-1
1963	-1	I then realized a major design flaw.	-1
1964	1	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.	1
1965	-1	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.	-1
1966	-1	Well wait no more!	-1
1967	1	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.	1
1968	-1	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.	-1
1969	-1	It's a little jewel.	-1
1970	1	Other than that, I love this camera.	1
1971	1	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.	1
1972	1	Have a great and easy to use bundled software	1
1973	-1	If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.	-1
1974	-1	"I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid ""legacy"" photographer for most of mylife."	-1
1975	-1	Canon says it's normal.	-1
1976	-1	With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.	-1
1977	-1	However, I do have a few things to complain about...	-1
1978	-1	This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!	-1
1979	1	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.	-1
1980	1	The panorama setting is unbelieveable !	-1
1981	1	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.	-1
1982	-1	The LCD should be used.	-1
1983	1	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!	-1
1984	-1	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.	-1
1985	-1	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.	1
1986	-1	My second child I didn't get any.	-1
1987	1	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.	-1
1988	-1	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).	-1
1989	1	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.	-1
1990	-1	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.	-1
1991	-1	Every time!	-1
1992	-1	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.	-1
1993	-1	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.	-1
1994	-1	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.	-1
1995	-1	Highly recommended!!!	-1
1996	-1	I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).	-1
1997	-1	I would not recommend buying that one.	-1
1998	-1	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.	-1
1999	-1	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.	-1
2000	-1	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -	-1
2001	-1	It takes regular trash bags.	-1
2002	1	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.	-1
2003	1	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.	-1
2004	-1	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.	-1
2005	1	(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.	-1
2006	-1	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.	-1
2007	-1	I just know it really worked for us.	-1
2008	1	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.	-1
2009	-1	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.	-1
2010	-1	This will never be a problem with the Champ.	-1
2011	1	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.	1
2012	-1	The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.	-1
2013	-1	So far so good.	-1
2014	1	and we definitely prefer our Champ!	-1
2015	1	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.	-1
2016	1	No need for deodorizers.	-1
2017	-1	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!	1
2018	1	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!	1
2019	1	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!	-1
2020	-1	"He thinks it is magic when the diaper ""disappears""."	-1
2021	1	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.	-1
2022	-1	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.	-1
2023	-1	Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.	-1
2024	1	Let the Champ win you over!	-1
2025	-1	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.	-1
2026	-1	It lives up to its name.	-1
2027	-1	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.	-1
2028	-1	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.	-1
2029	-1	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.	-1
2030	-1	I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.	-1
2031	1	It definitely keeps the smell out.	-1
2032	1	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!	-1
2033	1	It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?	1
2034	-1	You will be sorry after a few months.	-1
2035	-1	(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.	-1
2036	-1	So then I used straight bleach.	-1
2037	-1	FANTASTIC!	-1
2038	1	So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!	1
2039	-1	For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.	-1
2040	1	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.	-1
2041	1	This is one of the best purchases we made.	1
2042	1	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.	-1
2043	-1	It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.	-1
2044	-1	We hated that thing!	-1
2045	-1	I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.	-1
2046	1	It's also easy to empty out.	1
2047	-1	Presto!	-1
2048	1	"The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that."	-1
2049	-1	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.	-1
2050	1	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!	1
2051	-1	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.	-1
2052	-1	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!	1
2053	-1	Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.	-1
2054	-1	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.	-1
2055	1	"I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special ""diaper"" trash bags necessary."	-1
2056	-1	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.	-1
2057	-1	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.	-1
2058	1	Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)	1
2059	1	(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).	-1
2060	-1	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.	-1
2061	-1	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.	-1
2062	1	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!	-1
2063	-1	Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.	-1
2064	1	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!	-1
2065	1	even did while daughter sleep and no noise!	-1
2066	-1	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.	-1
2067	-1	"The ""new"" design still needs lots of improvement!"	-1
2068	-1	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.	-1
2069	-1	Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.	-1
2070	1	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).	-1
2071	1	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.	1
2072	1	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.	1
2073	1	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.	1
2074	-1	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!	-1
2075	-1	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?	-1
2076	-1	We liked it because:	-1
2077	-1	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.	-1
2078	1	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.	-1
2079	1	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.	1
2080	-1	We all hated it.	-1
2081	-1	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.	-1
2082	1	This is a great diaper pail.	1
2083	-1	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.	-1
2084	1	Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.	1
2085	1	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.	-1
2086	-1	It still smelled.	-1
2087	-1	I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.	-1
2088	-1	The positives outway the negatives.	-1
2089	-1	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.	-1
2090	-1	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.	-1
2091	-1	I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.	-1
2092	-1	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it	-1
2093	1	First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.	-1
2094	-1	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.	-1
2095	-1	So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.	-1
2096	-1	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.	-1
2097	-1	(I prefer 1/2 inch bits).	-1
2098	-1	I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.	-1
2099	1	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.	1
2100	1	But, for the money it is a good machine.	1
2101	-1	The sliding latch is does not stay in place.	-1
2102	-1	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.	-1
2103	-1	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.	-1
2104	1	Its well made and user friendly.	-1
2105	-1	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.	-1
2106	-1	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.	-1
2107	-1	It works well with the larger bits.	1
2108	-1	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.	-1
2109	1	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.	1
2110	-1	This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.	-1
2111	-1	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.	-1
2112	-1	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.	-1
2113	1	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.	1
2114	-1	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.	-1
2115	-1	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.	-1
2116	-1	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.	-1
2117	-1	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.	-1
2118	-1	"Hitachi includes a 1/2"" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table."	-1
2119	-1	At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.	-1
2120	1	I really liked the price...	-1
2121	1	This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.	-1
2122	1	This is an excellent router for the money.	1
2123	-1	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.	-1
2124	-1	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.	-1
2125	-1	The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.	-1
2126	1	It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.	-1
2127	1	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.	-1
2128	-1	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.	-1
2129	-1	It will take 31/2 inchers now.	-1
2130	1	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.	-1
2131	-1	Recenly the variable speed control went out.	-1
2132	-1	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.	-1
2133	1	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.	1
2134	1	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.	1
2135	-1	I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!	-1
2136	1	Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.	1
2137	1	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.	-1
2138	1	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.	1
2139	-1	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.	-1
2140	-1	"Not included are: - 3/8"" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering"	-1
2141	-1	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.	-1
2142	-1	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.	-1
2143	-1	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.	-1
2144	-1	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.	-1
2145	-1	It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.	-1
2146	-1	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.	-1
2147	-1	I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.	-1
2148	-1	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.	-1
2149	-1	They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.	-1
2150	1	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.	-1
2151	-1	I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift.	-1
2152	-1	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.	-1
2153	1	I would however highly recommend the m12v router !	-1
2154	-1	All in all, not very good.	-1
2155	1	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.	-1
2156	1	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.	-1
2157	-1	"The only complaint I have is that the 1/4"" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4"" bits."	-1
2158	1	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.	1
2159	-1	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.	-1
2160	1	I like the speed control.	-1
2161	-1	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)	-1
2162	-1	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!	-1
2163	-1	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.	-1
2164	1	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.	-1
2165	1	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!	-1
2166	-1	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.	-1
2167	1	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.	1
2168	-1	If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..	-1
2169	1	I did like the heft of the machine.	-1
2170	1	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!	-1
2171	1	Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.	-1
2172	-1	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.	-1
2173	-1	I think I'll go rout something...	-1
2174	-1	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.	-1
2175	1	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.	1
2176	1	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.	1
2177	1	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.	1
2178	-1	I have owned this router for nearly five years.	-1
2179	-1	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.	-1
2180	-1	I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.	-1
2181	-1	I looked at this router and bought a Makita.	-1
2182	-1	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.	-1
2183	1	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price	1
2184	1	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.	-1
2185	1	I prefer things that are simple.	-1
2186	-1	Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.	-1
2187	1	Cuts are easy and smooth.	1
2188	1	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)	1
2189	1	The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.	1
2190	-1	 As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.	-1
2191	1	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.	1
2192	-1	As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me.	-1
2193	-1	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.	-1
2194	1	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy	1
2195	1	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.	-1
2196	-1	Very Pleased.	-1
2197	-1	It DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.	-1
2198	-1	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.	1
2199	-1	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.	-1
2200	-1	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.	-1
2201	-1	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.	-1
2202	1	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.	1
2203	1	 Battery non-issue.	-1
2204	-1	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.	-1
2205	1	 The player is great.	1
2206	-1	Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.	-1
2207	-1	  Again, another hassle.	-1
2208	-1	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!	-1
2209	-1	 I wish I had a long time ago.	-1
2210	1	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?	-1
2211	1	It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.	-1
2212	-1	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.	1
2213	1	The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.	-1
2214	-1	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.	-1
2215	-1	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.	1
2216	-1	Yeah, pretty weak.	-1
2217	-1	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.	-1
2218	-1	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!	-1
2219	-1	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.	-1
2220	-1	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.	-1
2221	1	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.	-1
2222	-1	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.	-1
2223	-1	  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.	-1
2224	-1	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.	-1
2225	-1	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.	-1
2226	-1	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.	-1
2227	1	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.	-1
2228	-1	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.	-1
2229	-1	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.	-1
2230	-1	 I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.	-1
2231	-1	"God Save Apple	 I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac."	-1
2232	-1	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.	-1
2233	-1	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.	-1
2234	-1	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.	-1
2235	-1	"Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead	 If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look."	-1
2236	-1	 The user support service isn't too great either.	1
2237	-1	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.	1
2238	1	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.	1
2239	-1	" It ""feels"" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus)."	-1
2240	-1	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.	-1
2241	-1	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.	-1
2242	-1	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.	-1
2243	-1	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.	-1
2244	-1	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!	1
2245	-1	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.	-1
2246	-1	 However, you should still buy an iPod!	-1
2247	-1	 If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.	-1
2248	1	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.	1
2249	-1	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.	-1
2250	1	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.	-1
2251	-1	There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners.	-1
2252	-1	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.	-1
2253	-1	 However, with the iPod you cannot.	-1
2254	1	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.	1
2255	-1	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.	-1
2256	-1	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.	-1
2257	-1	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.	-1
2258	-1	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.	-1
2259	-1	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.	-1
2260	1	"For a sleeker, smaller and more ""average"" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful."	1
2261	-1	buyers BEWARE!	-1
2262	-1	 You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.	-1
2263	1	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.	-1
2264	-1	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).	-1
2265	1	SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.	1
2266	-1	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.	1
2267	-1	 I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!	1
2268	-1	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.	-1
2269	-1	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.	-1
2270	-1	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.	-1
2271	-1	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used	-1
2272	-1	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.	-1
2273	-1	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.	-1
2274	-1	 What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?	-1
2275	-1	They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).	-1
2276	-1	iPod will change the way you enjoy music!	-1
2277	-1	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.	-1
2278	-1	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.	-1
2279	-1	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.	-1
2280	-1	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.	-1
2281	-1	 I disagree.	-1
2282	-1	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.	-1
2283	-1	Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY.	-1
2284	-1	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.	-1
2285	-1	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.	-1
2286	1	 Really easy to use.	1
2287	-1	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.	-1
2288	-1	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.	-1
2289	-1	 Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.	-1
2290	-1	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.	-1
2291	-1	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.	-1
2292	-1	 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.	-1
2293	1	 The!  sound quality is great.	1
2294	-1	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.	-1
2295	-1	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.	-1
2296	-1	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.	-1
2297	-1	It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.	-1
2298	-1	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.	-1
2299	-1	Product Of The Decade	-1
2300	-1	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.	1
2301	1	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.	-1
2302	-1	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.	-1
2303	-1	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.	1
2304	-1	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.	-1
2305	-1	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.	-1
2306	-1	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.	-1
2307	-1	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.	-1
2308	-1	Buyer beware!	-1
2309	-1	Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.	-1
2310	-1	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.	-1
2311	-1	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.	-1
2312	1	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.	-1
2313	-1	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.	-1
2314	-1	 The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.	-1
2315	1	 The sound is just fine.	1
2316	-1	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.	-1
2317	1	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.	-1
2318	-1	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.	-1
2319	-1	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.	-1
2320	-1	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.	-1
2321	-1	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.	-1
2322	-1	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.	-1
2323	-1	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.	-1
2324	-1	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.	-1
2325	-1	But enought of the negativity.	-1
2326	-1	I'm glad I did.	-1
2327	-1	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.	-1
2328	-1	 I have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great.	1
2329	1	  It all sounds great too.	1
2330	-1	"  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the ""hold"" switch."	-1
2331	-1	You've earned a new fan.	-1
2332	-1	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!	-1
2333	-1	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!	-1
2334	-1	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.	-1
2335	-1	 The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.	1
2336	-1	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.	-1
2337	-1	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.	-1
2338	-1	Hard drive screws up occasionally	-1
2339	-1	I like it.	-1
2340	-1	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.	-1
2341	-1	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...	-1
2342	1	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.	-1
2343	-1	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.	-1
2344	-1	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.	-1
2345	-1	 The only problem is the battery life.	-1
2346	-1	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.	-1
2347	-1	It's a good way to pass the time.	-1
2348	1	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.	1
2349	-1	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.	-1
2350	-1	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.	-1
2351	-1	Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.	-1
2352	-1	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.	1
2353	-1	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.	-1
2354	1	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.	-1
2355	1	"I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the ""mixed mode"" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router."	-1
2356	-1	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.	-1
2357	-1	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.	-1
2358	-1	The other issue is how secure do you want it.	-1
2359	1	All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network.	-1
2360	-1	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.	-1
2361	-1	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.	-1
2362	1	No down time, great signal strength.	1
2363	-1	Just no internet.	-1
2364	-1	I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.	-1
2365	-1	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.	-1
2366	-1	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.	-1
2367	-1	Very disappointing.	-1
2368	-1	Stupid me.	-1
2369	-1	Great items !	1
2370	-1	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?	-1
2371	-1	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.	-1
2372	-1	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.	-1
2373	-1	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.	-1
2374	-1	Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD.	-1
2375	-1	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)	-1
2376	1	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.	-1
2377	1	I got it working fast enough.	-1
2378	-1	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.	-1
2379	1	It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.	1
2380	1	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.	-1
2381	1	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.	-1
2382	-1	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.	-1
2383	-1	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.	-1
2384	-1	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.	-1
2385	-1	The only way I got the thing working (this was with a DirecWay satellite):	-1
2386	-1	"However, your PC cards should also be Linksys ""g"" rated, as interoperability has been a problem on some ""b"" cards."	-1
2387	-1	If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.	-1
2388	-1	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.	-1
2389	-1	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.	-1
2390	-1	But since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.	-1
2391	-1	If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.	-1
2392	1	Installation was as near automatic as can be.	-1
2393	-1	I first purchased the Wireless G with Speedbooster.	-1
2394	-1	"Anyway, after learning that the ""Speedboost"" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5)."	-1
2395	1	This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year.	1

2399	1	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.	-1
2400	-1	I had an old wired Linksys router.	-1
2401	1	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.	1
2402	-1	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.	-1

2410	-1	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.	-1
2411	-1	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.	-1
2412	1	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.	1
2413	1	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.	-1
2414	-1	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.	-1
2415	-1	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.	-1

2420	-1	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.	-1
2421	-1	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.	-1
2422	-1	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.	-1

2425	-1	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.	-1
2426	-1	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.	-1
2427	1	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.	-1
2428	1	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.	-1
2429	1	The inital setup of the router was simple.	-1
2430	-1	SSID are like filenames in Windows.	-1
2431	-1	They!	-1
2432	-1	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.	-1
2433	-1	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.	-1
2434	-1	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.	-1
2435	-1	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.	-1
2436	-1	from the cable modem you are using.	-1
2437	-1	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.	-1
2438	-1	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.	-1
2439	-1	I've had this Linksys router.	-1
2440	-1	My mistake.	-1
2441	-1	Then this is the way to go.	-1
2442	-1	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.	-1
2443	-1	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.	-1

2447	1	Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly.	1
2448	1	New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration.	-1
2449	-1	First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.	-1
2450	1	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.	1
2451	-1	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.	-1
2452	-1	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.	-1
2453	-1	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.	-1

2455	-1	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.	-1
2456	-1	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.	-1
2457	-1	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.	-1
2458	-1	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.	-1
2459	1	It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up.	-1
2460	1	It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.	-1
2461	-1	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.	-1
2462	-1	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.	-1
2463	1	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.	-1
2464	-1	What about hookup and use?	-1
2465	-1	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.	-1
2466	-1	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.	-1
2467	-1	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.	-1
2468	-1	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.	-1
2469	-1	en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.	-1
2470	-1	Still, if you think there may be more computers in the future, and there is a need for a multi-port network.	-1
2471	-1	The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac.	-1
2472	-1	I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!	-1
2473	-1	I'm a male and that's what we do (or not do).	-1
2474	-1	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.	-1
2475	-1	I do know what wires go !	-1
2476	-1	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.	-1
2477	1	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.	-1
2478	-1	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.	-1
2479	-1	You are really the ones that need this the most.	-1
2480	-1	They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money.	-1
2481	1	It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is.	-1
2482	-1	The PC card setup was painless as well.	-1
2483	-1	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.	-1
2484	-1	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.	-1
2485	-1	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.	-1
2486	-1	Nope.	-1
2487	-1	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).	-1
2488	-1	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.	-1
2489	-1	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.	-1
2490	-1	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!	-1

2492	-1	") as opposed to ""gateway"", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem."	-1
2493	-1	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.	-1
2494	-1	"You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the ""User Guide"" tab which loads the manual."	-1
2495	-1	If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.	-1
2496	1	I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!	1
2497	-1	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.	-1
2498	1	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.	-1
2499	-1	I was able to use t!	-1
2500	1	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.	1
2501	1	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.	1
2502	-1	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?	-1
2503	-1	They have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux.	-1
2504	1	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.	1
2505	-1	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!	-1
2506	1	There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it.	-1
2507	-1	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.	-1
2508	-1	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.	-1
2509	-1	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.	-1
2510	1	In addition it is very easy to setup.	1
2511	-1	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.	-1
2512	-1		-1
2513	-1	Very annoying.	-1
2514	1	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.	1
2515	-1	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.	-1
2516	-1	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!	-1
2517	-1	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).	-1
2518	-1	Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.	-1
2519	-1	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.	1
2520	1	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.	1
2521	-1	Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.	-1
2522	-1	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.	-1
2523	-1	The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.	-1
2524	-1	I'm addicted to music.	-1
2525	-1	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).	-1
2526	-1	This is a must have.	-1
2527	1	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.	1
2528	1	"Oh, and another is the cool ""halo"" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer."	-1
2529	-1	This feature wo!	-1
2530	-1	Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).	-1
2531	-1	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.	-1
2532	1	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.	-1
2533	-1	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).	-1
2534	-1	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.	-1
2535	-1	That was before the Zen Micro came along.	-1
2536	-1	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.	-1
2537	-1	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).	-1
2538	-1	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.	1
2539	1	The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid.	1
2540	1	If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.	-1
2541	1	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !	1
2542	1	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.	1
2543	1	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.	-1
2544	-1	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.	-1
2545	-1	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.	-1
2546	-1	I know what you are thinking.	-1
2547	-1	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.	-1
2548	-1	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.	-1
2549	1	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.	-1
2550	-1	The photos don't do it justice.	-1
2551	-1	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.	-1
2552	-1	You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player.	-1
2553	1	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.	1
2554	-1	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.	1
2555	-1	Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.	-1
2556	-1	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.	-1
2557	-1	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.	-1
2558	-1	I'm a new to mp3 players.	-1
2559	-1	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.	-1
2560	-1	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.	-1
2561	-1	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.	-1
2562	-1	While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.	-1
2563	-1	It COULD have been a great product.	1
2564	1	This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features.	1
2565	-1	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?	-1
2566	-1	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.	-1
2567	1	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.	1
2568	-1	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.	-1
2569	-1	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.	-1
2570	-1	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.	-1
2571	1	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.	1
2572	-1	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.	-1
2573	-1	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.	-1
2574	-1	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.	-1
2575	-1	I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc....	-1
2576	-1	Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!	-1
2577	-1	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.	-1
2578	-1	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .	-1
2579	1	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.	-1
2580	-1	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.	-1
2581	-1	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.	-1
2582	-1	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking	-1
2583	-1	It was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.	-1
2584	-1	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.	-1
2585	-1	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.	-1
2586	-1	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.	-1
2587	-1	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.	-1
2588	-1	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!	-1
2589	-1	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.	-1
2590	-1	Pick your favorite color and buy it.	-1
2591	-1	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.	-1
2592	-1	Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.	-1
2593	-1	Now, about the iTunes.	-1
2594	-1	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.	-1
2595	-1	"(Like I really wanted ""Hotel California"" anyway."	-1
2596	-1	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.	-1
2597	1	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.	1
2598	-1	out the bulletin boards.	-1
2599	-1	After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.	-1
2600	-1	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.	-1
2601	-1	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.	-1
2602	1	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.	1
2603	1	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.	-1
2604	-1	Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.	-1
2605	1	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!	-1
2606	-1	So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.	-1
2607	1	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.	1
2608	-1	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.	-1
2609	1	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.	-1
2610	-1	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.	-1
2611	-1	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.	-1
2612	-1	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.	-1
2613	1	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).	-1
2614	-1	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.	1
2615	-1	**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives.	-1
2616	-1	-doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed.	-1
2617	-1	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !	-1
2618	-1	2.	-1
2619	1	It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.	-1
2620	-1	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.	-1
2621	1	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.	-1
2622	1	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.	1
2623	1	Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!	-1
2624	1	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.	-1
2625	-1	If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.	-1
2626	1	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.	-1
2627	1	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.	-1
2628	-1	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.	-1
2629	-1	4.	-1
2630	-1	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!	-1
2631	-1	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.	-1
2632	-1	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.	-1
2633	1	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.	-1
2634	1	I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.	-1
2635	-1	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.	1
2636	-1	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.	1
2637	-1	What compels you to choose one over the other?	-1
2638	-1	So I decided on the black one.	-1
2639	1	Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes.	1
2640	-1	Going further up-market and using super hi-rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill; they will only serve to cast MP3 limitations into sharper relief, and honey, you can't hear what ain't there.	-1
2641	1	best in class.	-1
2642	-1	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.	-1
2643	-1	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.	-1
2644	-1	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.	-1
2645	1	But it; you won't regret it.	-1
2646	-1	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.	-1
2647	-1	2.	-1
2648	1	I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.	-1
2649	-1	"My list of ""nice to have"" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage."	1
2650	-1	It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.	1
2651	-1	The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.	-1
2652	-1	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.	-1
2653	-1	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.	-1
2654	-1	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.	-1
2655	-1	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.	-1
2656	-1	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.	-1
2657	-1	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.	-1
2658	-1	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.	-1
2659	-1	Within one month, my player completely died.	-1
2660	1	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).	-1
2661	1	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.	-1
2662	-1	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.	-1
2663	-1	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.	-1
2664	-1	The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.	1
2665	1	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.	-1
2666	1	The hardcase they give with it must work well.	-1
2667	-1	It has to be the UI and user experience.	-1
2668	1	The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.	1
2669	-1	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?	1
2670	1	Flawless.	-1
2671	1	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!	-1
2672	-1	Why isn't it?	-1
2673	1	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.	-1
2674	-1	jack that Creative has acknowledge.	-1
2675	-1	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.	-1
2676	-1	Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative.	-1
2677	1	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.	-1
2678	-1	3.	-1
2679	-1	he Pencil?	-1
2680	-1	that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.	-1
2681	-1	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.	-1
2682	1	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.	-1
2683	-1	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.	-1
2684	-1	Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.	-1
2685	1	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!	1
2686	-1	I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features.	-1
2687	1	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.	1
2688	-1	Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game.	-1
2689	-1	I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.	-1
2690	1	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.	1
2691	-1	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.	-1
2692	-1	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.	-1
2693	-1	I say get one today!!	-1
2694	-1	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.	-1
2695	-1	"Comments such as ""it's stylish"" or ""it looks cool"" or ""everyone has it"" don't nesseseraly make something good."	1
2696	-1	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.	-1
2697	1	) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup.	1
2698	-1	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.	-1
2699	-1	The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.	-1
2700	-1	The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.	1
2701	1	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.	-1
2702	-1	The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass.	1
2703	-1	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.	-1
2704	1	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.	-1
2705	-1	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.	-1
2706	1	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.	-1
2707	-1	I have my reasons.	-1
2708	-1	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.	-1
2709	-1	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.	-1
2710	1	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.	-1
2711	-1	I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC.	-1
2712	-1	6.	-1
2713	1	The battery is removable.	-1
2714	-1	"Let's just say it's no coincidence I put ""Foxy Lady"" on there."	-1
2715	-1	This is by far my biggest complaint.	-1
2716	-1	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.	-1
2717	-1	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).	-1
2718	1	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.	1
2719	-1	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.	-1
2720	-1	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.	-1
2721	-1	(iTunes being an exception of course).	-1
2722	1	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.	1
2723	1	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.	1
2724	-1	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.	-1
2725	1	Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate.	-1
2726	-1	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.	-1
2727	-1	You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.	-1
2728	-1	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !	-1
2729	-1	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.	-1
2730	-1	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.	-1
2731	1	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.	1
2732	-1	The included headphones suck, so get your own.	-1
2733	-1	Who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether.	-1
2734	-1	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.	-1
2735	1	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.	-1
2736	-1	e again.	-1
2737	1	I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!	-1
2738	-1	I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results.	-1
2739	1	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.	-1
2740	-1	If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.	-1
2741	-1	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2]	-1
2742	-1	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.	1
2743	1	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.	-1
2744	-1	Amazing.	-1
2745	-1	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.	-1
2746	-1	It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.	-1
2747	-1	I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version.	-1
2748	-1	m.	-1
2749	1	This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.	1
2750	1	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.	-1
2751	1	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.	-1
2752	-1	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.	-1
2753	1	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.	1
2754	-1	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.	-1
2755	-1	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.	-1
2756	-1	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.	-1
2757	-1	All this before I found out the bad news.	-1
2758	-1	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.	-1
2759	1	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.	-1
2760	-1	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.	-1
2761	1	Gets nice sound too.	-1
2762	1	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.	-1
2763	-1	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.	-1
2764	-1	Then what?	-1
2765	1	The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk.	-1
2766	-1	)  Compatibility?	-1
2767	-1	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.	-1
2768	-1	After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files.	-1
2769	-1	I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase.	-1
2770	-1	Try an additional *six* hours, methinks.	-1
2771	1	I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.	1
2772	1	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.	1
2773	-1	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.	1
2774	-1	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.	-1
2775	1	The interface works great.	1
2776	-1	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.	-1
2777	1	FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.	-1
2778	-1	5.	-1
2779	-1	If only only it was that simple.	-1
2780	-1	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.	-1
2781	-1	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.	-1
2782	-1	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.	-1
2783	1	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.	-1
2784	1	Everything shines of quality.	-1
2785	-1	Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.	-1
2786	-1	3.	-1
2787	-1	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.	-1
2788	1	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.	-1
2789	1	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.	-1
2790	1	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.	-1
2791	-1	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.	-1
2792	-1	Too bad.	-1
2793	-1	"The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] ""to go""."	-1
2794	-1	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.	-1
2795	-1	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.	-1
2796	1	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.	1
2797	1	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.	-1
2798	1	"While I have not had the ""privilege"", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones."	-1
2799	1	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.	-1
2800	1	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.	-1
2801	-1	Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.	-1
2802	1	I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.	1
2803	-1	Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.	-1
2804	-1	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).	-1
2805	-1	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.	-1
2806	-1	Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.	-1
2807	1	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.	-1
2808	-1	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.	-1
2809	-1	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.	-1
2810	1	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.	-1
2811	-1	3.	-1
2812	-1	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.	-1
2813	-1	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.	-1
2814	-1	I also experimented with an adapter for the car.	-1
2815	-1	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).	-1
2816	-1	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.	-1
2817	1	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.	-1
2818	1	It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course.	1
2819	-1	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.	-1
2820	-1	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.	-1
2821	-1	You ask, yup.	-1
2822	1	Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways.	-1
2823	1	It's good.	-1
2824	-1	The title pretty much says it all.	-1
2825	-1	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.	-1
2826	1	Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).	1
2827	-1	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .	-1
2828	1	But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.	-1
2829	-1	They really are awfully small.	1
2830	-1	It was a major step up from a Sony t68i.	-1
2831	1	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.	-1
2832	-1	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.	-1
2833	1	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.	-1
2834	-1	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.	-1
2835	1	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.	1
2836	-1	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \	-1
2837	-1	"I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message ""Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."""	-1
2838	1	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.	-1
2839	1	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.	1
2840	1	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.	-1
2841	1	Give each friend a different ringtone.	-1
2842	1	I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.	-1
2843	-1	A firmware upgrade is irrelevant .	-1
2844	1	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.	-1
2845	-1	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.	-1
2846	1	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.	1
2847	-1	I'm used to having to restart things.	-1
2848	-1	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.	-1
2849	1	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.	-1
2850	1	The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.	1
2851	1	Its nice look is also a plus.	1
2852	1	1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.	-1
2853	-1	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.	-1
2854	-1	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.	-1
2855	1	If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.	-1
2856	-1	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!	1
2857	1	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.	-1
2858	-1	This is no small deal.	1
2859	1	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.	-1
2860	-1	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.	-1
2861	1	Capacity is not a problem here.	-1
2862	1	Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.	-1
2863	-1	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.	1
2864	-1	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.	-1
2865	-1	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!	-1
2866	1	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.	1
2867	1	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.	-1
2868	-1	a bit dissapoitnd on that!	-1
2869	1	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.	-1
2870	-1	They stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $120.	-1
2871	-1	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.	-1
2872	-1	i may have been up for this 10 years ago, but i just want a phone that works at this point.	-1
2873	1	"The bottom line is ""Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones""."	-1
2874	-1	This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).	-1
2875	1	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.	1
2876	-1	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?	-1
2877	1	Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.	1
2878	-1	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.	-1
2879	1	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !	1
2880	1	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.	1
2881	-1	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.	-1
2882	1	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.	-1
2883	1	I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.	-1
2884	1	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.	-1
2885	1	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.	1
2886	1	It has great upgradibility.	1
2887	1	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.	-1
2888	-1	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!	-1
2889	-1	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..	-1
2890	-1	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .	-1
2891	-1	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.	-1
2892	-1	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!	-1
2893	1	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.	-1
2894	1	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.	-1
2895	-1	Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .	-1
2896	-1	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.	-1
2897	1	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).	-1
2898	-1	namely, it wouldnt sync.	-1
2899	-1	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.	-1
2900	-1	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.	-1
2901	1	4. The Build is just right.	-1
2902	-1	1) phone card calling feature.	-1
2903	-1	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).	-1
2904	-1	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.	-1
2905	1	With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.	-1
2906	1	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.	-1
2907	1	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.	-1
2908	1	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).	-1
2909	-1	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.	-1
2910	1	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).	1
2911	1	Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.	1
2912	1	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.	1
2913	1	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.	-1
2914	1	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.	1
2915	1	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).	-1
2916	-1	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.	-1
2917	-1	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.	1
2918	-1	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.	-1
2919	-1	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.	-1
2920	1	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)	-1
2921	1	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!	-1
2922	-1	Sometimes, various applications crash.	-1
2923	-1	Simple.	-1
2924	1	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.	1
2925	-1	"The ""movies"" last about 5 seconds."	-1
2926	-1	so, right out of the box i had issue.	-1
2927	-1	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.	-1
2928	1	I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).	1
2929	1	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).	1
2930	-1	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).	-1
2931	1	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.	-1
2932	-1	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.	-1
2933	-1	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.	-1
2934	1	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.	-1
2935	1	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.	-1
2936	-1	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.	-1
2937	-1	If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.	-1
2938	-1	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.	-1
2939	1	7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.	1
2940	-1	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.	-1
2941	-1	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.	-1
2942	1	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.	1
2943	-1	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.	1
2944	-1	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.	-1
2945	-1	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.	-1
2946	-1	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.	-1
2947	1	I like the size and shape.	-1
2948	-1	Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.	-1
2949	-1	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.	-1
2950	-1	I use this phone exculsivly with a Jabra Freespeak 250.	-1
2951	-1	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****	-1
2952	-1	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.	-1
2953	-1	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.	-1
2954	-1	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.	-1
2955	1	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.	1
2956	-1	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .	-1
2957	-1	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.	-1
2958	1	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.	-1
2959	-1	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...	-1
2960	-1	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.	-1
2961	-1	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!	-1
2962	-1	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.	-1
2963	-1	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..	-1
2964	1	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.	-1
2965	-1	Yes, certainly.	-1
2966	1	Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.	-1
2967	1	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.	1
2968	-1	Go see for yourself.	-1
2969	-1	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.	-1
2970	-1	Me likes.	-1
2971	1	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.	-1
2972	-1	"The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that ""Can be delayed further""."	-1
2973	-1	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)	-1
2974	1	I think the interface is great.	1
2975	1	The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.	-1
2976	1	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.	-1
2977	1	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.	-1
2978	-1	"All you need to do is to choose your ""phone card"" contact and then ""send touch tone"" and choose the contact."	-1
2979	-1	2) Low volume on regular answering.	-1
2980	-1	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.	-1
2981	-1	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.	-1
2982	-1	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.	-1
2983	-1	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.	-1
2984	1	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.	-1
2985	1	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.	1
2986	-1	This is representative of the entire phone operation.	1
2987	1	6600 looks and feels nice.	1
2988	-1	"Also, when I dial an ""800"" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu."	-1
2989	-1	This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.	-1
2990	-1	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!	-1
2991	1	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.	-1
2992	-1	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.	-1
2993	-1	Avoid at all costs	-1
2994	-1	But those 2 come up every time.	-1
2995	-1	As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).	-1
2996	-1	The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.	-1
2997	1	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --	-1
2998	1	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.	-1
2999	1	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.	-1
3000	-1	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.	-1
3001	-1	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.	-1
3002	-1	It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)	-1
3003	-1	I really liked the firewall.	-1
3004	-1	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.	-1
3005	-1	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.	-1
3006	1	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.	-1
3007	-1	"We constantly got ""Windows Virtual Memory Low"" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes."	-1
3008	-1	First, I turned off my cable modem.	-1
3009	-1	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!	-1
3010	-1	I don't have one good thing to say.	-1
3011	-1	Norton has a name in the market but I think it's only the name.	-1
3012	-1	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.	-1
3013	-1	"Warning! The Windows ""remove program"" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program."	-1
3014	-1	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.	-1
3015	1	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.	1
3016	-1	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.	-1
3017	-1	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.	-1
3018	-1	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.	-1
3019	-1	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.	-1
3020	-1	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.	-1
3021	-1	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)	-1
3022	1	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!	-1
3023	-1	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.	-1
3024	-1	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.	-1
3025	-1	Anti-Spam is Good	1
3026	-1	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!	1
3027	-1	So I expected the same level of quality and ease of use with their Internet Security program.	-1
3028	-1	After installing, the system froze trying to restart (this is a new computer with Windows XP Home).	-1
3029	-1	"I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a ""customer priority ID number."""	-1
3030	-1	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.	-1
3031	-1	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.	-1
3032	-1	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.	-1
3033	-1	Had to uninstall it.	-1
3034	-1	I gave up trying to figure how to get my email sent or listen to streaming programs.	-1
3035	-1	I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.	-1
3036	-1	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.	-1
3037	-1	I have gone to their site many times in the last two months looking for an answer.	-1
3038	-1	So, we're fed up.	-1
3039	-1	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.	-1
3040	-1	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.	-1
3041	-1	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.	-1
3042	-1	And that's a shame.	-1
3043	-1	Well, no more.	-1
3044	-1	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.	-1
3045	-1	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.	-1
3046	-1	This is a very full featured product.	1
3047	-1	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.	-1
3048	-1	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.	-1
3049	-1	"You can ""disable"" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running."	-1
3050	1	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.	-1
3051	-1	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.	-1
3052	-1	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)	-1
3053	-1	I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years.	-1
3054	-1	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.	-1
3055	-1	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.	-1
3056	-1	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.	-1
3057	-1	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.	-1
3058	-1	I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.	-1
3059	1	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.	-1
3060	-1	BEWARE!!!!	-1
3061	-1	I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.	-1
3062	1	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.	-1
3063	-1	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.	-1
3064	-1	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.	-1
3065	-1	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.	-1
3066	-1	I just about lost it this morning with this software.	-1
3067	-1	"They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to ""handle"" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails."	-1
3068	-1	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.	-1
3069	-1	I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.	-1
3070	-1	After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.	-1
3071	-1	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.	-1
3072	-1	"Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for ""Internet Security 2004""."	-1
3073	-1	"I used ""Add/Remove Programs"" to unistall NIS 2003."	-1
3074	-1	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.	-1
3075	-1	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.	-1
3076	-1	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)	-1
3077	-1	It checks every 5 minutes for virus and spam definition updates.	-1
3078	-1	This product is absolutely not ready for release.	-1
3079	-1	Avoid this product at all costs.	-1
3080	1	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.	-1
3081	-1	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.	-1
3082	-1	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.	-1
3083	1	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.	1
3084	-1	Wish I had.	-1
3085	-1	We were leary to say the least, but decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt.	-1
3086	-1	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.	-1
3087	1	"Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the ""Programs"" directory."	-1
3088	-1	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.	-1
3089	-1	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!	-1
3090	-1	I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004/Professional.	1
3091	-1	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.	-1
3092	-1	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.	-1
3093	-1	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!	-1
3094	-1	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.	-1
3095	-1	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.	-1
3096	-1	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.	-1
3097	-1	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.	-1
3098	1	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.	-1
3099	-1	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.	-1
3100	-1	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.	-1
3101	-1	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).	-1
3102	-1	Okay, how can I say this nicely?	-1
3103	-1	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.	-1
